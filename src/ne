Flight 2646.  Four hours in the plane on the ground at BWI.
"I'm aware of the flight details, thanks. Three hours Late Flight a crew that could not give less of a shit"
@USAirways Discovered our flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday at 3:30PM - @americanairlnes finally notified us our flight was Cancelled Flighted at 0316 AM
tried ringing but told me to try again Late Flightr. I'm supposed to be leaving in an hour...
@AmericanAir. For two days now I have been trying to reach #AmericanAirlines customer service to change my flight.
@usairways Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled. said I'd have to pay $75 for earlier flight at next gate. Today @delta proactively offered same for $0
@USAirways How r u supposed to change flights when u can't get thru to reservations? #OneHourOnHold
"iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer"
"no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible."
not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care
and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
@USAirways This was a real life exercise in crisis management which @USAirways failed miserably. Some compensation would go a long way.
@USAirways the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday
"""sorry you were disappointed"" #outoftouchwithreality #people have kids and jobs"
"once again you guys didn't let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming"
there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
"screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #."
"I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,"
@USAirways you are absolutely terrible at managing these delays... Been delayed and undelayed and delayed 6 times now. 10 AM office hours.
@USAirways you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I'm officially done flying with you.
Im trying to call and book a reward ticket on one world partners but your automated system wont let me talk to any1.  Great job
the wifi in the ewr lounge reminds me of the old days of dial up
sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
can't change it. True blue points and I can't get to a phone
they booked me for tomorrow. It's $250 higher. My 1st reservation is PGFRYZ. Get me on standby list 4 tonight would help.
@USAirways Flight Cancelled Flighted because of #Neptune Could not get to my destination. #notmyfault  #waive$200fee #ripoff #poorcustomerservice
"really needs to get a a clue and start treating people like humans, not animals.  #americandairlinesSUCKS"
@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
"tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
@jetblue I missed a goal On @NHLonNBCSports because of your Inept male stewardess. I should have landed already but I havent taken off yet.
what is going on with the flight 2417? It has been delay a lot .
- holding us hostage for about an hour with no updates if they are taking us to NY or not. What's going @southwestair
@southwestair please help us check in... i never expected you to make travel painful... just like the rest all of a sudden...#intlcheckin#
they responded. I can't respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever
"is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, you're not that bad!"
"Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight..."
"to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep"
"@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
"Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff"
.how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I'd rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks!
Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn‚Äôt have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It‚Äôs a dumb delay.
My flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm needing some help reFlight Booking Problems.
@USAirways seriously with all the service issues you are having right now this is what you decide to tweet?? Unbelievable
my flight was delayed 4 hrs. I'm 5 months pregnant &amp; supposed to be caring for my mom whose in surgery now. Very upset.
@BernhardtJH I did eventually get through but that flight Cancelled Flightled.  Decided to drive but gave up holding to process refund
"the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus 5."
"@USAirways I listed my baggage claim number.  Have them call me, my number is on the ticket.  I had to use Lady Speed Stick this morning."
"WTF, my flight was delayed and then I go to board and my boarding pass has disappeared from the Southwest app!"
talked to a manager and she offered we pay 3X's in cash what we originally paid #nothanks #jetblue #ripoff #flyunited
"719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!"
3078 is overweight so you pull 2 dozen passengers off? Why not luggage? Seriously?
after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets
They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
@USAirways always letting me down. üëä
Monday evening.
way to fuck up and lose @c_istudios bags. My husband has no warm clothes and no equipment. #youdidit #notcool
Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
40 minutes still haven't talked to one person #shocking phone is gonna died before I talk to anyone http://t.co/iWoiGRLHXb
"@USAirways Secondary screenings, a piece of the plane missing... Anything you want to tell us?"
@dmb41shows I need this plane to get to buffalo so I can leave tonight. Any progress?
@USAirways has the worst customer service. Can't even get through to a rep you gotta be kidding me
"I need to speak to a REAL PERSON. My flight was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation, and I've been on hold for more than 3 hours."
&amp; I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now
@USAirways so apparently all of your computers crashed at BWI?  Any update on when flights will be moving?
next up: enforcing your boarding procedure.
Anyone answering phone this morning at 800IFLYSWA? On hold 51 minutes and counting...
@USAirways Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer.
"""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
"As am I, - but thankfully there was a lounge next door. Really not impressed by oneworld partnerships :("
I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
"After being patient about my ""delayed"" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!"
I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
"reFlight Booking Problems would not have made me reach on time for my meeting. Also didn't wanna take a chance, Booked myself on @etihad instead"
@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip
flight Cancelled Flighted out of LAX for tomorrow due to connection in DFW. Help please? we can go out of orange or burbank
@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
"@SouthwestAir, I've been on hold for 3 hrs. now, waiting to talk to someone with a pulse to get my Cancelled Flighted flight rescheduled. Is this SOP?"
@USAirways Now going on 26 minutes on hold.
"SJC-&gt;LAX. After the fourth time, I gave up!"
@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
@USAirways should look into better service‚úåÔ∏è
- AA1344 Cancelled Flighted on 2.23 - rebooked on us air 623/544 on 2.24. Has to be a nonstop on 2.24 for us (2)?
@USAirways so does that mean that you might care about my sister be assaulted on one of your flights
I am going to keep these tweets coming till AA does something...which I know is nothing..hoping I go way...not likely.
@USAirways and no offers to provide us with a hotel or anything for a flight that is over 19 hours away!
"I understand that, but I'm not even being put on hold - it says ""try again Late Flightr, goodbye""."
"@AmericanAir, ask your new colleagues @USAirways how they handled US 728 on 21 Feb. I expect to be made whole again. Check complaint inbox."
@USAirways Just contaced EYEWITNESS NEWS about the ripoff the Cancelled Flighted now they want me to pay
"@JetBlue
the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
 What happened 2 ur vegan food options?! At least say on ur site so i know I won't be able 2 eat anything for next 6 hrs #fail
I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe??
please send help ASAP to @KathrynSotelo on flight 5957 to Chicago seat 9c #Airlines http://t.co/9sKrLyrZ1O
you have Cancelled Flightled my flights because of my last name. Do the right thing and reinstate my tickets
@USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers.
worst airline! You Cancelled Flight our flight and don't even let us know even though we are traveling with children.
understood ... but could I go and put myself on the standby list 5 hours prior to my flight?
Have been trying to reach American Airlines since last evening to Cancelled Flight flights. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! What now???
