### Course objectives ###
This course aims to equip beginner-level students majored in Computer Scinece
with essential mathematics for pursing their study in Computer Science.
It is designed to articulate students in reading and writing formal description
of mathematical concept, understanding basics of computation, and reasoning 
properties of data structures (e.g. sets, relations, permutations, graphs, and 
trees). This course is also purposed to broaden student's interests in 
Computer Science by engaging the fundamental conepts with their applications in
real-world.

### Materials ###
#### Textbook ####
[Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications, 8/e](http://www.firstbook.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=books&wr_id=289) authored by Kenneth. H. Rosen  
This book can be found in *Handong Book* on campus. It is **mandatory** for every class participant to hold a copy of this textbook: it will be assumed that every student is able to access the textbook by himself/herself anytime in this semester for doing homework, team projects, etc.
