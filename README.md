# Discrete Mathematics, Fall 2021 #

### Course information ###
* Meeting time: Tue/Fri, 4:00--5:15 PM
* Meeting location
	* onsite: OH 401
	* online:[https://handong.zoom.us/my/hongshin](https://handong.zoom.us/my/hongshin)
* Instructor: Shin Hong https://hongshin.github.io / hongshin@handong.edu

### Course objectives ###
This course aims to equip beginner-level students majored in Computer Science
with essential mathematics for pursing their study in Computer Science.
It is designed to articulate students in reading and writing formal description
of mathematical concept, understanding basics of computation, and reasoning 
properties of data structures (e.g. sets, relations, permutations, graphs, and 
trees). This course is also purposed to broaden student's interests in 
Computer Science by engaging the fundamental concepts with their applications in
real-world.
