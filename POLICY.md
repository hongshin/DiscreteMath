Class Policy
=====
### Communication ###
#### English ####
English is the official language of this course. As specified in the university
policy, students in a 100% English course must use English in all formal
activities, for instance writing homework, assignment report, midterm and final 
exam answers; non-English parts will not be counted at all kinds of evaluations.

The instructor must use English in delivering class contents (e.g., lecture, 
assignments, exams). Students are highly recommended to use English for asking 
questions and participating in discussion. 

Yet, to promote active participation, students are allowed to use Korean for 
question and class participatio; in this case, the instructor will repeat 
Korean sayings in English. In addition, the instructor can use Korean to
rephrase what he had already said in English; in this case as well, 
the instructor repeat in English what he said in Korean for double-check.

#### Contact with Instructor ####
**Questions**: Use the class channel in Slack. 
Make questions publicly, so that I can share the question and my answer 
easily with all class members. For this reason, the TAs and I will not 
response to any personal contacts (e.g., Slack DM, e-mail).

**Administrative requests**: Use Handong LMS and LMS Messaging.
For claiming attendance update and discussion point, you must put a post to 
``Open Board``, or leave a comment at the corresponding post publicly. 
This makes the claiming process accountable and transparent to all class members.

For a case where privacy matters, you first write a public post and then 
send the instructor a message via LMS to tranfer privacy-sensitive information
(e.g., a proof for an approved absence).

**Counseling session**: Students can request a counselling session to the
instructor to ask academic advice. 
To make an appointment with the instructor, submit an answer to the following
pre-interview form: https://forms.gle/KbREJ1b5S13nD51V7. 
When a new submission is received, the instructor will send a reply to arrange 
a personal counseling session. Note that the instructor does not arrange any 
personal meeting at an exam season.

**Improper solicitation**: All kinds of improper solicitations are strictly 
forbidden as declared in the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act 
(aka. *Kim Young-ran* Act). For example:

1. Students MUST NOT give a gift in any form to the instructor or TA (even a can of coffee)
   while they are officially students in Handong University
1. Students MUST NOT ask the instructor or TA to change their gradings or evaluation results. Meanwhile, students can claim for correcting errors in evaluation.
1. Students MUST NOT ask the instructor or TA any kind of unfair evaluations, even for exceptional cases. If you want to claim for an execute due to your exceptional circumstance, you must discuss the concern with the Student's Academic Affair Team. Only upon the official request from the Student's Academic Affair Team, the instructor may change the rule/policy for execuse.
Any violation of these will be reported to the Academic Affair Team for treatments.
