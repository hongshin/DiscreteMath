"@USAirways did I mention I'm a silver preferred member and fly every week (not always with you), and not even a meal voucher?"
That will be the third time I have been called by 800-433-7300 an hung on before anyone speaks. What do I do now???
it's taken care of already. I've come to expect this level of horrible service from you time and time again
flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
Worst customer service ever. You Cancelled Flightled my connecting flight to NY hours ago &amp; didn't tell me. Now I'm stuck in Tampa.
"@USAirways Hey, my bag was damaged flying with you yesterday. What can I do?"
Now your site is not working! WTF
Can I get some assistance? Flight Cancelled Flightled (today) from PHX to DFW. Not that I'm hating. But my job is concerned
I've been on hold for over an hour and counting…just need a simple name change http://t.co/5Siczx1oez
sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.
I am genuinely surprised you all don't upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot
 called your service line and was hung up on. This is awesome. #sarcasm
"Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power &amp; lifevests on the floor #UA992 …"
@USAirways 'preciate it but cant get off plane to speak w agent / wont come on plane 5015 knoxville...?
I hope so but I've received no help so far. I've been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me?
You sent me a cheque today which can’t be paid into a UK bank account. VERY annoying!
"UA5029 from RIC, UA507 from ORD, &amp; UA423 from DEN -ALL DELAYED for non-weather issues. Way to go, youre batting 1.000! But no hotels"
 what is going on with customer service? Is there anyway to speak to a human asap? Thank you.
tried to enter that rapid rewards contest link on facebook but all my browsers kept popping up security warnings 4 it.
"i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?"
now a delay to the rebooked flight?!
"I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight"
 having trouble getting rebooked
why haven't you allowed for flight changes into the NY area airports tonight?  Everyone is saying travel is treacherous.

"although, I am stranded in Chicago O'Hare for another 8 hours. Any chance your cracker-jack service team could provide a meal?"
"I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans"
"no, we are at a hotel.  Also, Jetblue lost my daughters luggage.  How do you lose luggage if the plane never actually left!!!"
how does that help me with my customers that I couldn't meet with (and subsequently lost)?
my wife sent me a family invite but I never accepted it. She should not be locked into a family account that never got created.
Brothers baggage was lost on route to 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup Championship in Columbia. His race is Sunday. Please help.

@USAirways I keep calling your help line (800) 428-4322 and it keeps saying they are too busy to help &amp; to call back Late Flightr. FOR A WEEK NOW!
"I can’t go back to the airport, I’m working, and won’t have time.  Are you telling me there is seriously no other way?"

3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.
I'm showing flight 4720 delayed again. Would my boarding pass still be good or was my seat given away?
I have been trying to get through to someone about my Cancelled Flightled flight tomorrow for over 4 hours.
not for me.  I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax.
thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. 😉 Can I tweet at the TSA??
UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.

It's sad how I can't afford any long distance trips though. :/
please please please answer the phone. . .
"I want to add, my flight to Mexico was on Air Canada. Same exact situation, but with none of the problems I've had with Jet Blue."

@USAirways day has come where I was suppose to get my money back from you but my bank hasn't received anything but after
@USAirways we've now learned to never fly with u again. You've lost 16 customers from our group + the hundreds more from our company
Why can't I find a cheap flight from DC to St Louis? The prices went up like crazy for April weekends!
Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
“Inconvenient” is such a convenient word.
I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
"here is the ticket they gave me after lying, raising their voice. With no explanation on what happened http://t.co/31cFHtK60r"
“@JetBlue: @Analystdoc Unfortunately that's not an available option with our current system. Sorry guys. That's a certain #fail Fix it plz.
.Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
"@USAirways @marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn't get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline"
"if I'm about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed."
^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here.
free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
never fails to have delayed flights 😡
"seems like queue times are very high, in Q waiting for an agent 4 almost  an hour.Flight got Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/sDm2wvR3zr"

"if u miss first leg of ur flight, you have to pay hundreds of $'s just to keep your second leg? How much to keep my earned miles?"
@USAirways how about a phone # to talk to a real person?
@USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter
don't ever tweet me again
"Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
@USAirways what is the expected wait time to speak to someone via 800 number?
@USAirways where's my apology?
can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
"- how long does it take to get credit to my AA account? Traveled in Jan &amp; only one leg reported. Asked for credit, no response."
@USAirways worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together.
@USAirways why aren't you updating flight status/delays?
@USAirways @SDFAirport  I really needed to be back home yesterday and at work at 9am today. Been on plane and sitting for an hour #peeved

how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
paid for my own $200 rental car just to not go through this for the 3rd day  :(
"also, they said they couldn't even book the flight. They were having to put me on hold &amp; have someone else do it???"
 it was a disappointing experience which will be shared with every business traveler I meet. #neverflyvirgin
Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful?
@USAirways HELLO?! It's been FOUR HOURS since plane landed!   Flt 630 phx to JFK.  3 hrs on Tarmac waiting 4 gate. Plus an hour no bags yet
thanks for the response - flight time has passed - rebooked now
it's noting about me i m perfectly fine it's the attitude and dealings with flyers. Stubborn. Demanding. Unwilling to accommodate.
"I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can't seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help?"
apologies help. Would have been nice had supvsr. Sally in CLE offered one. Not usual gr8 southwest customer service I love
"@USAirways first, luggage got stuck in a different city, now I get them back today &amp; one of your employees stole a pair of gloves from me!"
I understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on...
"flight to BOS Cancelled Flightled, no flights till TUESDAY, spent $1000 to get a flight through another airline + $170 for hotel. Refund"
"your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??"
Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
I have been on phone with rep for over 30 min and was transferred after asking not to be. She was the worse rep I ever had
@USAirways @_RobPrice  how can he try again it will be 5-6 hours before he gets help.  Contingency plans non existent.
what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I'm astounded at the lack of concern about customer's flying experiences.
haha that's fine. Still won't fly ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
We tried with multiple people. I already sat on the phone for an hour and a half and got nowhere.
more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
Finally starting to come out. 40 minutes and no communication is not acceptable. Letting me down today.
no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow
pls help. This is seriously beyond ridiculous.
@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
@USAirways Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to computers being down. What backup plan is in place for this??
I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
"been waiting in line for over an hour in San Antonio, barely moved &amp; only two agents. 30 in front of me &amp; at least 40 behind."
so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service.
@fly2midway 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night.
Hi AA ! I placed an itin on hold to expire on 2/27.Just logged into my acct..its gone! Seat hasn't been released to inv. Help?
Bad enough that there is no seat assigned he's  seating at an exit seat and a male flight attendant removes him from there
@USAirways how about checking the plane before having everyone board the plane? #pissed
Close down
nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
"passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn't at the bar."
"@campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"

"@USAirways any way to tell our gate we are going? Stuck on tarmack, int'l flt FLT 878 going to ELM Gate F6"
I have never had such awful customer service and conflicting service. Outrageous.
"But expect no help from -&gt;&lt;-.  Our flt was canx at the last minute for ""weather.""  We flew home on weatherless @united."
 I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
 Another delayed flight? #likingyoulessandless
"- I get that weather delays are not in your hands, but is there nothing else you can offer for the massive inconvenience?"

6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?

have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
" Hi, I'm trying to do check-in but the website is not working. I tried 3 different browsers and the problem continues"

@USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(
"then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it"
@USAirways Past tense re help. No more. It’s been even more miserable than usual at CLT.
"@USAirways no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself"
@USAirways you can send my luggage to my house👋
I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
what's yall corporate number bc yall are not trying to accommodate me at all!!!
@USAirways will never travel with you again. This is insanity. storms are inevitable but making us hold to just add a lap child #badservice

My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
- Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
- with airport self checkin your only option I'm now your employee. Training was a bitch. Send my paycheck asap.

@USAirways is not the new is more like the new @SpiritAirlines. Love AA. Not impressed with the subpar planes and gate agents.

@USAirways you have to be crazy! Treated my mom very poorly. Not happy! #usairwaysfail
But it's doubtful he'll fly United again and he will be traveling a lot as a sales manager covering all of North America
I'm still on hold if you're wondering...  4 hours 37 minutes and counting.  #ServiceFail #OnHoldForever #Suboptimal
so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
@USAirways I'm sure you don't but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won't come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. Tks.
2nd leg of trip Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold 1.5 hrs. Will we lose our $ if we don't speak to someone before first flight leaves?

yes and the auto rebook confirmed an outbound that departs after the return flight.  # fire the software programmers
@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer.

TSA Pre isn't showing up on my boarding passes and I've followed all of the steps. Please help.
found out my flight tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled &amp; got in the queue for a callback 3.5 hours ago…still nothing. Can I get rebooked??
Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
I've been on hold ANOTHER hour and still nothing. My Cancelled Flighted flight was supposed to be six hours from now. #Stranded
is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys 💔😪
"Didn't find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail."

a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.

@USAirways had to Cancelled Flight 4 of my flights because my versace biceps wouldn't stow completely under the seat in front of me.
#4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest.

@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
@KyleJudah be responsible for replacing it

@USAirways still waiting on a response
"@USAirways can you get me home to Syracuse? After 6 Cancelled Flightled flights, one re routing three of us are sitting in Charlotte"

"@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer"
@USAirways you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.

Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
westjet and your rep won't do anything about my lost luggage- which I never even checked with westjet because it was lost in
@USAirways #2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door!
is your website down? I haven't been able to check in to my flight all morning.
are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
@USAirways your IVR hung up on me because of high call volume? I need help. Call me
Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
"never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot."
just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year.
were stuck on a plane in Dallas that's supposed to be going to Okc. There's an issue w/ the plane. Any idea on how much longer?
I changed my own flight to tonight. Why couldn't AA do that on my behalf instead of a flight tomorrow? Poor effort all around.
"flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today!"
"flights been Cancelled Flightled, can't get through to the desk and nothing showing online under my reservation - what do I do?"
"@USAirways Yes, there is horrible snow. But seriously, can you not hire more people to answer the phones? Competitor have call back numbers."
is Flight 3113 OMA&gt;DEN on 2/21 actually Cancelled Flightled? Been on hold for over an hour and your website says conflicting messages
rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. Too bad the pilots didn't do the same. #stillwaiting.
"Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta"
"very confusing to receive ""your trip is around the corner!"" email when I already Cancelled Flightled the flight"

@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
#delayed again! You're killing me Late Flightly!
I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
no I will be calling corporate!
"cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in and exp the worst flight ever!"
is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fiancée and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
"after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"
a voucher.. I can't believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face..
@USAirways Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever.
 SFO-PDX schedule is still MIA.
 ugh Dump us in dfw w/no luggage then Cancelled Flight our flight 3 more times. Sat arrival now Tue?
"DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks"

"sorry so Late Flight, responded to your DM."
Only fluctuated because aa took 2 hrs to call me back.Ended up paying (extra) in $US so above statement not true
you suck.    9 hour delay?!
I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
when the pilot announces that the plane has been unused for 2 days and maintenance is dealing with another aircraft..
"Just got a call from baggage dept. ""...still looking for your property"". It's went missing 1/28. PRERECORDED NO HUMAN SERVICE!!"
Unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. Missed dinner
"sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags"

"Call me Chairman, or call me Emerald. After what you did today to me, you can call me a former customer."
why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
I hope not to see the same issue on my return flight tomorrow
been on hold for 1.5 hrs. What's up?
Stuck in. ORD because United can't find their airplane. Lol. #upset terminal right now.
what's the hold up with flight 6475 from SLC to DEN??
. Death of a dear friend has me heart broken but #AmericanAirlines has me heated!
there were seats but after waiting on hold for 20 minutes they were gone-now she has to stay another night in charleston-very pricy
wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
@USAirways so the seat next to me (19B) on flight 1943 to Seattle has a tray table that is falling off... http://t.co/HAJ5lKqjW4
The problem is apologies don't help. Results matter and it's proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that.
why is t that every time I fly jfk even more speed doesn't work waiting for 10 min #nogood
@USAirways I do to as I have an afternoon Conference in Las Vegas and I would rather plan ahead than run thru the airport and then attempt

I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
.ReFlight Booking Problems for the following day is unacceptable. DMing you that and our phone number.
flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
"@USAirways  ""please call Late Flightr"" is not acceptable - but neither is being on hold for 5+ hrs #onholdwith"
"@USAirways This is garbage, been trying to book a reward flight and then it got Cancelled Flighted and still can't get anyone on phone. Unacceptable"
I am trying to book another flight and apply my credits that I had from another flight but I can't find them.
"please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight?"
@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
- cruel &amp; unusual to Cancelled Flight flight w/o notice &amp; make someone stay on hold for 30min &amp; listen to the same ad in a loop
Customer service said it was a known problem that they were using same confirmation numbers for domestic and international
"Am I the only one who had to look that up? I must be getting old..
I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours?
@USAirways the ads on your phone systems when waiting for a rep is the most annoying thing ever especially when waiting for over 10 mins...
"1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution"
@USAirways No one answers your reservation phone line. I need to book travel with a  companion certificate. How do I get through?!!!
interested in possibly changing my flight to another day...need to see if there are any fees but your number is busy
"your staff at LaGuardia and Lagos, Nigeria were unprofessional, uncaring and not helpful. Ou"
you put a sour taste on this customer’s vacation. it was joke watching those “we care thanks for choosing us” videos
now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages. What's wrong with you guys?? http://t.co/wVGpp3Ymz1
appreciate the response Worst part is losing the non refundable hotel in Orlando. Your crew blamed wind! Hoping for no more delays!
We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.
thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE
 I'm disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers
Can you transfer my bags too?
"yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
 I have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! I've been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes..........
"@lpdstock tweet bots obviously don't get sarcasm, making computers more and more like real people."
Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages.
@USAirways I have been rebooked but It has been handled very unprofessionally. Cancelled Flightations happen but the disorganization is uncalled for.
"weren't too ""sincere"" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home.."
"@USAirways can't seem to find the pilots for our 6pm flight, never seen anything like it before #drunkpilots http://t.co/Zira2z3UDc"
"and btw, the @Virgin and managed on time departures same time same destination- &amp; wouldn't take away a 9year old kids bag!"
what a pointless tweet. At least asked me to follow them to try and resolve
@USAirways how is it possible that someone is drunk they bring a wheelchair for them but you keep serving them
@USAirways don't think you guys could mess things up any more.. Never flying with you again!
"the person I talked to couldn't do anything not normally available online other than the ""no charge"" part."
Understood but I watched as fam heading to FL was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. I am speaking at conference in SF
i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times!
tells me $130 paid &amp; confirmed flight will now cost me $566.80 CASH ONLY @ airport  22 hours before my flight  #RIPOFF #NoSupport

"it has now been 16 days since i applied for my compensation

is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!

Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
Boooo!!!!!!   Don't be like the other airlines!!  http://t.co/WHAGPknnLF

@USAirways no online clearly states I can NOT- It says to call res. I already explained that.
there is two hour wait
@USAirways I tried calling for yet another delayed flight and was told the phone line couldn't handle the volume and was hung up on. Twice.
@ZKatcher @bretharold does it look like to we talked to customer service? http://t.co/vYUAnh4Iqr
4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
"yes, they said the runway isn't ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight."
are you ignoring me on purpose? It was sad enough having your automated system hang up on me 😭
is really gonna hear my mouth about this bag situation.
costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
@USAirways thanks for nothing
"No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a concern, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward."
I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly again.
flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won't give luggage back. Nice.
"That makes sense. It sucks, though, because now I'll be stuck in the airport for 5+ hours and Late Flight to my meeting."
@USAirways still can't get through and travel in 2 days. #ridiculous #donthavehighhopes

"need assistance. very frustrated I can't reach reservations by phone. trying to book online &amp; get ""fare no longer avail"" msg"
@USAirways How soon is possible? I boarded the plane the 1st time at 6:30 am and it is now after 11:30 am and I'm still where I started.
can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection?
where is my bag?? I'm in Mexico about to go build a house &amp; my suitcase never got on my flight from CLE w me. I need it. SAN68059M
Need to hold or get a call back. Just get hung up on by your phone system for 6+ hours now.
@USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw.
"@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP"
@USAirways not yet. But we will see shortly.
 Other carriers are less than half price for a round trip fare. I am stunned. http://t.co/UKdjjijroW
@USAirways Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me?

@USAirways 2 and a half hours on hold... Hope it feels good to be a steaming pile of shit.  paid far too much for you.
@jetblue any idea what caused the delay on flight 1316 FLL &gt; Jax ?
spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
@usairways I get extended hold times due to the weather...but 2-1/2 hours on hold (and counting). HELP!!
@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
can you get a gate for UA4727?  Turrible.
@danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff
are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
better do the right thing and take care of @Cowboycerrone or els you're losing business!!!!

@usairways @BarclaycardUS 1 hr wait so far for customer service. yes bad weather but do air traffic controllers answer your phones?!??
WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? next time.
"experiencing the worst customer service ever currently. Waited for CS rep, then put ""on hold"" but actually was hung up on."
"has grounded 2 flights b/c of equipment problems &amp; been rude to my wife, traveling alone w/our 2 young kids.  never again."
@USAirways I just got hanged up on trying to get to an agent. Can you help?
"^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround"
.Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm. Stuck in SFO for four hours.
@USAirways Saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service.
I'm asking if you can simplify the communications- thx
.can you connect me to a person without having to wait 2+ hours on hold? I still haven't been able to resolve the problem.
Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.

Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have
The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
 had to change to another airline to get to DC today ... Why is able to land in DC but not you? Cost me $800 ...ugh
@USAirways in 140 characters? Yea right.   Thanks for patronizing.
 sad to learn you no longer fly SFO &gt; PHL. Hope it returns!
Why not deal with that while the plane's on the ground instead of diverting the plane &amp; adding 2 hrs to the flight?
 You'd think paying an extra $100 bucks RT for luggage might afford you hiring an extra hand at @sfo #lame
I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
@USAirways now you don't know where my luggage is?  Seriously?
how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
"Been dealing with a Cancelled Flightled flight since last night &amp; was booked to a 6:15 flight,wouldve at least liked to see Ella perform lol"

"again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
@USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone.
I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone

"@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF"
it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
hey! DM not working. UA 307!
@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
@USAirways we are missing our connection due to delay out of LAS. What are we supposed to do now?
4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.
On hold for 45 minutes trying to rebook a Cancelled Flightled flight with a companion ticket. Help?
" 18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"
first flight is Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold for 4 hours. Need information and getting none. Help?
is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service
"@USAirways I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase."
"has screwed me over for the last time.  @SouthwestAir, glad to give you my business. #JetScrew #AwfulCustomerService"
@USAirways seems to be the only airline without a dedicated line for status members
I've had TERRIBLE service in three airports in 10 hours. Glad they don't care we kind of need to be home. #SellMyPointsSoon
airlines delayed our flight on the way to Chicago and leaving Chicago. Next time it is.
had a very rude gate agent at BWI tonight gate B8 after a 6.5hr delay for flight 1172. I think a little training is in order.
This doesn't address my issue. I am on hold for 30 min to speak with an agent.
Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What's up with that???
flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can't help me
@USAirways sad experience today on 4663.  Family on Southwest direct to MCO. My loyalty to USAir = not vacationing with my boys today.
took our BOS to BWI plane for a flight to StL and promised a replacement  1.5 hours Late Flightr. Now 2.5 hours delayed. Not happy.
40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
"if by near the gate you mean sitting on the plane for almost 2 hours, then yeah."
"@USAirways I want my money back. Now we're sitting on the runway. After a 2 hour delay, waiting for the baggage to begin loading."
I interviewed yesterday as a flight attendant I was the last person the recruiter said they lost my file n came back to interview me
@USAirways Only water on flight 763 to DCA? This is the first time I've ever seen this happen. #ExecutivePlatinumMeansNothing #IWantCoffee
@USAirways so you're not honoring miles with that were traveled last year?
"@USAirways Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience"
you are beyond redemption. Jfk. Baggage claim looks like a luggage warehouse
gah this is so frustrating! Nobody has my address here in the USA. Where are my bags!?!? So disorganised!!!!!!!!!!!
I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies
now you change my gate and don't tell me? What the fuck is wrong with you people. Learn to do your fucken job
@USAirways will one of you please answer the phone?
 You have any flights flying into Boston tomorrow? I need to be home and you Cancelled Flightled my flight and didn't do anything
@USAirways  Interesting you forward compliments but never complaints!  World's worst airline #GoingForGreatnessFAIL
The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.
"too bad I'm getting this memo: ""Your reservation contains modifications that prevent you from changing it online."" #FUSTURATED"
My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
why won't the site let me book tickets for nov for jfk to kin?
"@FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
On last flight of the day no less. I am now driving 4 hours to Aspen thru a snowstorm Thx to your teams lack of customer empathy
@USAirways Thks 4 tip. Seems like a workaround rather than a customer-friendly solution. They should have an easily accessible email.
@USAirways flt 470 Tampa to CLT is very Late Flight gonna miss conn to BOS what can you do?
emailed AAdvantage for status match ... still waiting.  Can't wait to move from but help me out here :)
"Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"
I don't know- no one would tell me where they were coming from - I would guess so as that's where we had all the changes to flights
3 months of straight travel ahead. Time to find new airline.
I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
@USAirways Thank you. The website crashing for me.
"not cool to announce a flight ""delay"" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering  no help."
@USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?
please send me a number to call to talk to a person and not be put on hold
"@USAirways Your whole handling of this was a joke.Boston Logan had one little old lady,ONE handling all the customers http://t.co/DH2rfUIJYP"
"yes it is in Dulles and I need it delivered to the Embassy Suites in Herndon, VA. I'm still in Chicago from the fiasco in LAX"
overall lack of attention or foresight when managing flights.
@USAirways  ! THE WORST in customer service. @USAirways ! Calling for over a month to book a flight! #poorcustomerservice #usairwaysfflyer
do you not try to get customers to their destinations? No help to get on another airline if you had no flights for 3 days?
why was Flight 1856 delayed to Buffalo ?  It’s a direct flight and the plane is at the gate.
How? It is not possible to call SWA on the phone. You put me on hold for an hour and then cut me off.
your website was down all day yesterday- tried 3x put all info in&amp;didnt go thru- today the flight I bought went up!
@USAirways 2102 DCA-BOS. Cancelled Flightled after making us wait over an hour. If I fly USAir every week can you upgrade my status proactively?
"@USAirways flight 813 DCA to CLT stuck waiting on CLT ATC. Cmon #FAA Missing flt 826 CLT to MBJ, hope you can rebook me! 816?"
don't merge with an airline that ain't ready for prime time and book your elite flyers on it! #NotHappy @USAirways #NeedCoffee
"Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead."
"i tried all day. Have been disconnected due to ""heavy call volume."""
@USAirways @caterobbie if that link worked most of us could take care of ourselves  please contact your tech people to get that working
I did. Still haven't heard a thing.
not sure why we are being made to stand in line outside for plane that isn't ready to board when I could be sitting inside
"@USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled."
"Thanks. Two hours to go inflight, then hotel.  Hang in there with all the DFW travel delays AA team."
all I want is to know what to do regarding my connecting flights since my 1st is Cancelled Flightled. Could you be of assistance?
"sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards"
"@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks"
@USAirways So you Cancelled Flightled my flight AGAIN? are you paying for my hotel?!
@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!
where did my travel bank credit go?  I can't call you right now.
"sent. looking for that functionality in your app, though. should be a one click action."
@USAirways Would you guys please send service agents to gate B15 in Philly?  All the people missed there connections and there's only 2.
"@USAirways after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic"
"Was on hold for 2 hours before you disconnected me after my flight was Cancelled Flightled. Swell company, you."
@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
Is there an email address I can send some thoughts to? This experience was really not good &amp; I have some feedback.
lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr.
still waiting 4 our bags. Web STILL can't tell me its location . How come @UPS @FedEx can tell u at any given minute where it is?
well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up   try paying overtime and bring in more people
8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.
"@nrhodes85 isn't it funny that @USAirways just apologizes, but doesn't actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? #NotImpressed"
"the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent."
"@usairways Row 16, flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need."
but to make us tru to find space in other flights.  This customer service is as bad as @SpiritAirlines.
I would like to send an email to Lost and Found at JetBlue JFK; I spoke to them this morning but cannot drive their today.
Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
Cancelled Flightled my flight without explanation and won't pick up the phone...25 minutes and counting.   #customerservice @olive201
"got it, so it's just paying extra not to sit in the way back. Awesome. Never again."
aa223 being ignored
2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!
"pls help me get this resolved &amp; reimbursement made.  gracias, rico; pls send me private msg with phone number or email address"
@USAirways if I cant get through to reservations how can they take a look? 2+ hour hold times are not reasonable in any industry!
@USAirways I will. Is it down or is just me?
last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online?
@USAirways but only for certain flights from CLT-NYC. The notion that you can't rebook customers for 48 hours is absurd.
flight ua90 is taking off now after 1750 was delayed over 4 hrs 30 passengers to miss their flight to tel aviv
"@AmericanAi
"@Kaneshow @InternJohnRadio @mrerickv THIS IS EVERYTHING... now, return that jet so we can go to Miami!"

"@USAirways TRBL experience! 2 hrs on the Tarmac for an inch of snow IN PHL ""No hanger open"" &amp; ""a pile of snow""?  #terriblecommunication"
Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.
I had to call back five times to get someone on the phone who knew what they were doing. By that time my getaway went up by $200.
have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals
@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
"@usairways. Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins.   Now flight further delayed.   Don't lite a match either http://t.co/mT8sPlm02v"
@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
"BTW I was completely unable to buy wifi for my flight using Galaxy S4. Couldn't zoom out or scroll to touch ""Buy"""
hahahaha! This is crazy! Well here's to another night at the airport!!
thx. Come hell or high water...
  It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
.being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again
@USAirways I gave up http://t.co/2eDgc6TbLs
apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today?
@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alternatives.
you're flight attendants suck and are always rude :( 4th bad experience with JetBlue tonight :/
@USAirways can we hold two seats for 11:35 flight from PHX to Las 1856 as this delayed flight 556 is not going to arrive on-time
"even so, change could not be made  online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers!"
Thank you for the acknowledgement. The IFE didn't work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system.
Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight
I've been trying to call your reservations desk for past 12 hours and can't get through.  This is not what I expected.
Not very helpful if my flight is already Cancelled Flightled! What about reFlight Booking Problems? AA has my email and cell - yet no notifications.
"thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks"
"instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers"
I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
 you stink. Flight Cancelled Flighted from PSP to JFK and no notification or ability to rebook #disappointed.  #expected better
flights from sunny SFO delayed for hours and others Cancelled Flightled left and right with little updates. Any help @SouthwestAir?
again another ride SW employee that printed out boarding passes. Deficiency in training obviously
why did you just Cancelled Flight flight 670 last minute?!?
Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
@USAirways how do I change flights . 3 hours is crazy please help

they couldn't do it sun then it was supposed to be mon after 6pm then today from 11 to 3 then from 6 to 8
I don't like making a scene but this hasn't been addressed properly. Please have them do that.
the worst flying experience I've ever suffered through. I'd appreciate my money back.
I hope you're happy! You have officially become the next #ProfitBeforePeople IMO you will be bankrupt by 2020
@USAirways your staff at LAX really messed up on this one. Failing to scan my suitcase tag.
and thx for not responding
Jacquelyn at Charlotte just denied me compensation after #2251 was Cancelled Flighted due to plane malfunction well within your control
I have never on all my trips on any airline ever nat'l or int'l ever experienced anything like this!
work on the comm skills w hate agents at PHX. Said I was confirmed on flight out of DFW &amp; got here and that was only standby.
@USAirways any word on flight 1748 getting out of DFW in the near future? Stuck on plane at gate for over an hour
called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz

I would appreciate an answer on why we weren't alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect
I Cancelled Flighted my flight. I really don’t need this much trouble.
your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
@USAirways if you DM me we can take this offline. Would love more info on location of lost bags. Any help is appreciated.
@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?
"Checked in on app since yesterday. Confirmed upgrade &amp; carry on, got to counter &amp; manager upgraded somebody else on my seat!"

"Also, group 5 is total BS."
"in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight."

pathetic service
@USAirways worst experience ever!!!!
Been on hold 34 min so far trying to book seat for my infant. Price increased $42 in meantime. What do I do?
no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
The word failure means: an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success nonperformance of something due.

"after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 to""arrange pick up""in argentina,claiming tollfree: won't reimburse me. Help!"

"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"

Been sitting outside our gate for 30 mins at LGA. Why no move to another gate? We'e baking on this plane!?! flight #3415
I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!

"Been on hold over 90 minutes. You can fly, but not answer the phone?"
It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
@USAirways as far as being delayed goes… Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!

"way to ruin a vacation, my brother has called all night and had multiple places in line only to get dead air on call back"
@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.

".Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO"
@USAirways I'm traveling around the world until the end of the year. 800 numbers do me no good.
they wouldn't let me on. Real nice of you! Just love your awesome service. And U have 2 people working this customer service line..
which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
@USAirways we've (flight 4443) been sitting on the tarmac of dca for a while now waiting on a gate. Can we just use another gate?
"before departure, while people who are delayed get up to $200 to compensate their time.."
flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
"wrote back saying 'it's been a challenging week...that's for sure"" - no shit."
@USAirways just lost a faithful customer.
"almost 2 hours on hold, 2 hours of my life I can't get back.... Thanks http://t.co/IyUZM2PUVS"
I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight
can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
"Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room"
I have almost 3 million miles w u so I am loyal to u.  When r u going to reciprocate?  What a joke
" congrats, you just got all my business from EWR to SFO/LAX. Fuck you fl1289 SFO/EWR was the clincher..."
@USAirways really nigga.. Ur a fuck boy
"- In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules."
"@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment."
"I was abused , threatened and forced to travel in a lower cabine (last seat) in yesterday's flight from Houston to Sao Paulo"
I do I was on UA 495 LAX TO DEN - we are scheduled to land LAX @ 7:38 am - please rebook to Denver - best flight
you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
@USAirways but the automated message says the line is too busy to join the queue! #stuckintheloop
@USAirways what's happening with 1217 Phl to LAX? Now 3 hr delay. Poor communication!
"why are flights still getting out of Logan now? You couldn't manage to get one out at 6 AM, when it wasn't snowing!"
@USAirways I can't wait for the @nytimes and @WSJ to find out how poorly @USAirways handled this situation. #shameful http://t.co/HHOxQPsUbA
congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
I'm going to need you to answer your phones. Being on hold for an hour isn't okay.
"can't get anyone to deal with me in person. Cowardly customer service, I can't be looked in the eyes by anyone."
@USAirways sits on a throne of lies
did I mention one bag is an infant car seat &amp; we've been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads
"Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-
37 minutes??????
"If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?"
@USAirways and it still says it's on time on your website btw
= easy and pleasant. = difficult and stressful. Learned my lesson.
"i hope it takes you 6 hours to get home when it should take 20. my flight was Cancelled Flightled because they ""couldn't staff the plane"""
you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
"flight 45 JFK-LAS. First the catering was Late Flight, the. No push back crew. 2hrs delay."
"you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem"
"You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who's left holding the bag
"Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour!"
friends been sitting in Houston since 7am flight Cancelled Flighted.Still don't have any answers. #BadCustomerService  #$10voucherwhatajoke
I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
"yo, you need a new website really badly. This day and age..."
can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD

@USAirways 40 minutes in baggage claim and no sign of luggage from our flight. UsAirways- your incompetence is overwhelming
@USAirways Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
half hour Late Flight leaving DFW...no attempt at an explanation
it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min
"No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't."
@ti2469 oh shiz i'm only 40 minutes into my wait after the first 3 hour barrier ...unbelievable
Pathetic answer. Just found out my bag has been sitting at LGA for 20 hours and no call from you to lmk or delivery of bag. BAD
your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0
what an incredibly arrogant thing to say while I sit here at O'Hare waiting for your incompetent airlines to refuel on a...
" I rang, but there is a wait for 35 minutes!! I can book the same ticket through a vendor, fix your site"
@USAirways I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father
"surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don't have a good feeling about your airline."
@DatingRev mco to lag two hour delay and sitting in Tarmac going on 40 minutes with infants crying on plane!! Get us off this plane
thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
"and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion"
"unless it's on you guys, im good."
3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
what is the problem with your flights to ny today
was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
 you're the best!! Whenever I (begrudgingly) use any other airline I'm delayed and Late Flight :(
45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
@USAirways now on hold for 2 hrs 20 min. This is ridiculous
"@bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that ""slight delay"" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation."
"I travel for business twice a week and after the fiasco, I'll be flying blue more often. Thanks."
why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
"we've been on hold for over 4 hrs, you Cancelled Flighted flt 2222 phl-dfw. Need assistance!!!"

u suck!we have been sitting here for 9hrs because of ur negligence
@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
I know one thing would NEVER treat their customers like this!!!!
why can't you take me to Knoxville?? yall are my fav #help
"oh it can get better apparently. After making us wait for a gate, psych!! Now we need you to de-ice before coming to the gate!!"
@USAirways So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges?
is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
"Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines"
comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn't give them accurate ticket number now we can't check in. #annoyed
"no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible."
"I ended up emailing my #Complaint to customer.relations@aa.com, hope that works. #TravelProblems"

@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?
you know I ❤️you but trying my patience - had easier cheaper ways from TPA to PDX but stuck w u. Turned my 3 hrs in MCI to 6
@USAirways you need to figure your scheduling out! #worstflightexperienceever #getmehome
flight for tomorrow morning Cancelled Flighted &amp; can't seem to rebook me. They can't even get me a seat. No clear answer on why Cancelled Flighted.
- you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!
that's funny because I emailed @VirginAtlantic once and they found it hadn't left LHR. In the mean time stuck with no bag in NYC!!!
 your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
but when do I get my gin &amp; tonic !?!?

you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
@USAirways another squashed flight. Having to share my seat with another passenger is not@my idea of quality travel
that all AA is for USAir Elite members. It's one big disappointment in the way we are treated. #epicfailure
@USAirways you are the worst.
I hate you all. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/uTdfqF5WPA

@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
If the flight I selected online was what was ticketed I would not be missing my connection. I need help getting to DFW or IAH!!

no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396

"but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform."

no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.
@USAirways and despite tailwind… Will still be Late Flight.
I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
@USAirways your service has been awful in Boston and I had to pay 25 extra dollars than I was supposed too I am very dissatisfied #mad
..... No crew at our gate.
how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really sad feeling to be ignored.
you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy

"9 hrs in Baltimore, still not going to get my baggage to greenville w me. This is just unbelievable."

hire more customer service agents. And hour and a half is too long to hold
@USAirways I expect something more than telling me to see an agent to rebook my flight...
is the worst. I have to postpone my trip and they can't accommodate guests like #NeverAgain
of course but they were just as helpless as everyone else .
Yes but they couldn't explain the 2 hour and 45 minute hold time.

Has AA Flight 296 from San Antonio to Dallas been Cancelled Flighted?
full to capacity. I also pid extra for these seats. Perhaps the crew could be more helpful.
I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.

and let FLT 2350 know I'm coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW
we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
no u don't
@USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously?
@USAirways 28 hours Late Flightr still no email. work supervisor needs documentation to approve last minute vacation day request
"@USAirways already called, no other options, flight is being reimbursed. Never again, you are unreliable for business travelers."
"@usairways yep, sent my bag to Philadelphia instead of Miami...I caught it...then was told my flight changed to tomorrow, wrong again #fail"
"great decision making skills flight ops IAH bag makes a 10 minute connection and I don't, flight pushed early. Disappointed!!!!"
@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
well I HAD a car &amp; free place 2 stay had I known Unacceptable treatment from Spvsr. Sally in Cleveland. #Disappointed
@USAirways @jtrexsocial i fell asleep from a call i placed midght.. guess what still on hold 7 am
 Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
absolutely no worries. I'm just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople
"Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing?"
"thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation"
"@derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?"
@USAirways I was told there is no record of my refund.  Can someone please help me. This has been a long day
@USAirways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy?
 placed on hold for total of two hours today after flight was Cancelled Flightled. Online option not available. What to do?
last 5 flights have all consistently ran behind schedule what's up with that ??
"missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight..."
I’m still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to?
"no after 75 mins of hold, I finally hung up! Ridiculous wait times. Can you assist in Cancelled Flighting reservation?"
whats going on with flight 2034.  Delayed beyond 834.  Shouldnt thre flights switch at that point?
@martysg Spoke to Corp. Customer Support already.  Shame.  Probably a reasonable and cheaper resolution to be had.  Regards
Your rubbish at Social Media! In the air two hours Late Flight but that's better than being Cancelled Flightled!
"2 hour delay while sitting on the plane and you still wanna charge me for beer? Nah, I'm good."
"@USAirways you got to be ""F""ing kidding me Usairways, 2hours on hold listening to yall selling loans and Valentine Flowers...SMFH"
"@USAirways Also, get excited, because he's going to be unable to contact you all from his destination, so you get to talk to me."
"Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line."
no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg
"@USAirways @KieranMahan needs two nights at a hotel in phoenix until he can get back to Philly because of plane equipment, crazy!"
flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
"@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business."
please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
"""...you in the 10 hrs we were hanging out there? Oh, no I understand things get crazy n sometimes 10 hours isn't long enough."""
@USAirways not Cancelled Flightling #837 because you don't want to put us in a hotel for night is our guess
@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
2hr and 20 min delayed...still waiting...you need to do something to improve... http://t.co/1m36NTPTR8
"yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can't rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc"
"If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?
at what point do u Cancelled Flight flights to DCA- other airlines have already Cancelled Flightled
"been on hold for over an hour.....not cool, you guys."
"your online site doesn't have flights listed in chronological order, resulting in a mis-purchase. Anything that can be done?"
My 11AM was canned. I empathize. But I think your Team has lost the right to be capitalized. It's a lowercase team day.
yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
@Cowboycerrone You apologise for HIS frustrations &amp; HIS disappointment but NOT your terrible service? #BlameShiftOverload
Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. http://t.co/WQZZtIemX0
@USAirways u are the worst airline ever figure out the merger #dontmakemegooutside
"@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled."
@USAirways I have nothing but issues when I fly w/u what's up w/that?! #travel #vacation #awful
what a joke. Hang up on customers!!
"(2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way"
"has the worst flights and customer service, this is the second time I've been Cancelled Flighted. Gotta pay for hotel and find rides now."
"again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won’t fix it."
"I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years."
@annricord $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets.
you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.
"glitches on website re: Flight Booking Problems travel &amp; checking in. Nothing between ur site &amp; the airport was communicated, it was a nightmare."
@USAirways Flt 4609 landed over half an hour ago. Not a single bag yet on the baggage claim. Hate you so much right now.
Twitter cust svc rule 1 Dont say IF we fell short. I just told u u did! #2 If u cant solve problem don't say anything at all!
of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
@USAirways so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff
"Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline."
You officially have the worst customer service of any airline I've ever dealt with. #southwestairlines #poor
"flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta"
@USAirways @nanceebing 4 hour hold times at the moment...and counting. #disgrace
Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
@travisamex It's not the weather. It's also gross incompetence. Understaffing. Crew forgetting to load bags. Don't duck truth.
"-- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of ""weather"" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled"
@USAirways  really u gave 6 scotch on the rocks to an out of control drunk and would not let my sister change seats when he was grouping her
says @USAirways  is the final carrier . Us air doesnt have it. I want my bag!!! Not a claim not an im  sorry. I want my clothes!!
I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!👎👎
I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
@USAirways I didn't even leave the airport and you sent 2 of my bags to Philadelphia!
"Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back"
@USAirways why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have  a connection?
2nd time in 4 days that my flight has been delayed and my gate agent hasn't said anything! Thanks for the memories. #NeverAgain
What do you call that??!!
@USAirways hey since you    f*%#ed my wknd can I have day pass to admirals club or meal coupon or free coke? {blank stare}
while busy on his cell phone ???
Worst airline ever. We have been stranded for 24 hours because of your 7 hour delay with flight 104 last night.
please pray for us that our gear is not lost or stolen due to YOUR incompetent employees. #CNN #ABCNews #MSNBC #Photography
"Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
"@USAirways 100 feet from the gate at PHL, but no ground crew. You can't make this up."
missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
 @FiDiFamilies us too! Terrible airline! Just gave us a hotel hotline number and said sorry
"@USAirways to CLT from JFK nasty planes, dirty seats &amp; floors, rude flight attendants- hopefully AA can get you cleaned up #disgusting #vile"
"@USAirways thanks to you, you have now incurred us approximately 2000 dollars in fees due to a staff members screw up.  #neveragain"
its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
can you not see the thread?
@Eleonora7 good luck I've been waiting a week
@USAirways got off stand by list and on earlier flight to DCA. What is the status of my checked bag? Was supposed to be on #4047 thanks
"cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF"
"I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board."
"As a frequent traveler, I've never been treated so coldly &amp; had an airline offer nothing when my flight was Cancelled Flightled. #nolove"
not sure I can trust a statement with that many small numbers above words. http://t.co/o3sRL1hfho

@USAirways GF was on hold for 4 hours and call was dropped!!! HELP!!!!! Need a flight!!!
I'm getting leathery from the heat on 4251 before I even get to Vegas....
@USAirways still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested.  Deal w this!!
i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimi😭 why dont you guys go to maimi???
your welcome. It was the thoughts of nearly the entire plane.
many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
why is customer relations still not open....in Texas?!
so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
you #fail. Snow coming to DC area. Tried to get on earlier flight. You refused. Now flight 6.5 hours delayed. Greedy and foolish.
@USAirways I would be on my way but   wether has delayed yet again.. Love the Charlotte ice storm!!  Good luck with mad customers
@USAirways really???  NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it's 11:30pm #NoExcuses
Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
you guys just rip me off if I could Cancelled Flight every flight I had booked for my employees I  would Buyer beware
"my wife has now been on hold for 90 minutes....I get weather is bad, but this is insane. #customerservice #customerloyalty"
"worst agents in US at Ft. Lauderdale Airport; passengers stand in line, getting status alerts &amp; still didn't make an announcement"
@USAirways spent 1.5 hours in line trying to get on a flight home tonight only for it to be Cancelled Flightled an hour Late Flightr. Not even snowing at DCA
"""Goodwill"" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136"
"i was also told by agents my issues ""aren't their prob"" K fine. I get it. But have some compassion 4 others dealing w/this!!!"
and now our arrival is delayed nearly 5hours. Yeah an entire day in an airport is not my idea of a stress less vacation #fail
@thirty_lives birthday is the 24th and he's not seeing Imagine Dragons at #DestinationDragons ?
"@USAirways - is stranding your customers, not reFlight Booking Problems them, and then not answering the phone the way you treat Platinum members?"
why do you bother surveying me!
Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
"Flight Cancelled Flighted, two hours on hold. Then it just hangs up! A little help here? -thx"
Worst airline ever?
you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
@usairways and @american please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue
it won't help...been there done that.
has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
your customer service is a disgrace.
2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
you need to have a look at your handling of flight 106 and 104. Company of yours size should have protocols in place to help
- i needed refund on my Cancelled Flightled flights this morning and had been on hold for more than an hour X 3. what to do?
@USAirways just informed of three hour delay. Pick up the phone and get me on another flight!
Is today's JetBlue Flight 918 (NYC-&gt;BOS) delayed? My app says on time and the website says it's not...
@USAirways on plane from BOS to CLT for 60 mins. Still at gate. Crew says system-wide computers preventing paperwork. Any info you can give?
.@USAirways I did but the more eyes I have looking for Pandu the better chance I have of bringing him home.
approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
"http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn."
"so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed."
"Hey, AA! There was a mistake made by your CR on my Flight Booking Problems. When I call your reservations #, I keep getting hung up on. Advise."
who can tell me where they are?
everytime I come back to Boston it's a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue?
@USAirways how long for a reply
3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
"just went to check into flight 24 hr advance, again husband and I are seated separately for 6hr flight! why does this happen??"
"waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!"
"I recommend upgrading your IVR and using call back, email, and texting from a know caller."
flight 790 you had us stuck on the plane for nearly 4 hrs. Set to take off only for flight control to deny us. THE WORST SERVICE
has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
 can’t access your website from Safari on iPhone 6. Seems to work on Mac and iPad. Need iPhone to add Passbook.
why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information
don't worry you won't steal my money again
i am here - what is your resolution?
"@USAirways tell them to get on that, please."
you guys should stop doing service in Denver it's horrible I get stuck here every time! I've been here almost 24hrs
so what are you going to do for me since I can't take the option you gave me. What type of refund will you do for me?
so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
@USAirways been trying to talk with a dividend miles rep for 2 days now. I have been holding for over 2 hours each day. What are my options?
"@airlines. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary"
your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
".you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now."
"tried to and got through the whole 2,000 characters and I was not even done."
@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
"MR, she's on her way now, but thought id detail the extravaganza for you... #dobetter #please http://t.co/V8PVpHMtZc"
Airline SUCKS! Customer Service SUCKS! NO courtesy! Incompetent - passengers do NOT matter- Bet the CEO is just doing fine though!
error message said couldn't process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. Agent was unaware of an (1 of 2)
false.
"she's still stranded in DC. Sat until 3:30am with 100 other kids. They were starving, and exhausted."
@USAirways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!!
that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
"@USAirways tough night, two 90 minute calls, on hold, delayed here in Phoenix for two days because of one aircraft not ready? Not acceptable"
 shame on VA for making people spend money in stranded cities when other airlines are landing at JFK! Who will reimburse me?
you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH?
I loved todays fight. But there was a bad draft on the airplane please add more air to air thanksm
Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
@USAirways more than an hour holding to change a flight on the phone now.. What's up with that???
"it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
@USAirways what's the deal with the flight computer network?
"worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting"
After 3 days NO BAGs amazing the way that you neglect customers
"Stop the madness ""@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Q5a7jtkI5K”"
did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
"I did, but no one can find the bag and we need everything in it in the next two hours."
@USAirways tells me to talk to about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
you are really trying me today.
flight was 2488 out of EWR STOP AT DALLAS THEN TO LA. I need to be in la tonight!
so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
"I keep getting disconnected after choosing the option ""unused travel funds"" on your automated customer service line! SOS"
"No no no. SWA low fares and on-time service is great! But manufactured quirkiness? Mmm, not so much. Signed, -CaptiveAudience"
what does relay concerns really mean &amp; how/why do u keep letting people on flights with bags larger than u state are allowabl?
@USAirways @Expedia 7 Hours for my friend to rebook his trip to Korea after @USAirways Cancelled Flightled a connecting flight to Chicago = IDIOTIC.
"Uwon't allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service?"
 I'm trying to check into my 10:50AM CT flight tmm on the desktop website and it's not working (some sort of caching bug) SOS
might be the worst airline ever
no updates on anything! All we know is there is an issue with the front wheels being locked.
you have to run the engine to troubleshoot an issue before boarding the plane!?! How about another plane? #aa2227 #miatoiah
the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
  I flew from NYC to SFO last week and couldn't fully sit in my seat due to two large gentleman on either side of me. HELP!
now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill
"if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!"
My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
"Your new mileage policy is awful. Before, I might have paid slightly more for United because of miles. Now there's no difference."
Jet BOOOO 🍅🍅🍅🍅 RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/0WbJAWx7xD
"Cancelled Flightled my flight, rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst @daysinn in existence. #fail"
- after having to now TAG MY OWN bags at the airport I was hoping they would actually arrive WITH me - here's hoping they arrive
 800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
we have. Twice. They said they can't dim those lights. But they did on our first flight.
@USAirways since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I'm confused since we had sunny skies
"SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
"no I've since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost!"
you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
@USAirways FINALLY leaving 4 home from NC. Will lodge respectful complaints!! Mechanical issue after cleared for runway? #5hourwait #nocrew

Thank you for credits. However; I submitted complaints about the property on vacation package. Hope you listen!
So you are inadequate by accident?

You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of ....
"@AmericanAir, I've been booked on the wrong flight! And now PE desk has a wait of more than 2 hours?!"
"no- we are boarding- but why can't your agents, on the phone, taking care of 1K travellers, link reservations?!?!!"
even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome
@USAirways You suck!!  Do you even know the meaning of contingency plan?????
"@USAirways if you mean by posted, no USAir empl to direct anyone, 800# not accepting calls, no contact from USAir re: rebook #greatjob"
"@dogbuckeye No, I was on hold for 4 1/2 hours.  3 diff agents each w/ different information, frustrating, kept getting txfd..."

Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)
Complete waste of an entire day. Pathetic.

I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
 is anyone doing anything there today?  Website is useless and no one is answering the phone.
"Stuck in Miami, and one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had. Will be sure to let everyone know about my time w/AA"

@USAirways I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call?
"this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, ""not yet located""?"
@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
smiling? NOT!!
"yes of course, before I left the airport. I kept looking but claim is still open."
@USAirways hey!!  Yeah last time I got a phone call when flight was Cancelled Flightled from DCA to BOS
Is your BWI-SJD service seasonal? Wasn't part of extension. Called intl desk. They didn't know. Want to fly in Sept on Sat.
three hour flight to Orlando and no wifi? Uncool. #firstworldproblems
I tried a burger which was good but expensive! Were lead to believe that food in the USA is cheap butnot here!

"Why not just take her info in the beginning and if cut off, call back? We do that in my medical practice. We are frequent flyers :("

@USAirways here's to sitting on hold for 4 hrs flight Cancelled Flighted and they disconnect twice. #fend4urself #stranded #diverted
@USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND
well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus
- That time when I spent a night trying to sleep in a toddler bed at the airport Ramada without my luggage you kidnapped #furious
Cancelled Flights arrivals &amp; departures in Nashville as of 5pm. That and more weather headlines @ 4pm #LiveOnFOX17 #FebruaryFreezeFox17
system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
@USAirways I've been on hold for 41min. Just trying to change my reservation.
trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
flight 1028 no delayed 1.5 hours.  Another week another delayed flight
@USAirways Looks like I'm already delayed and will miss my connecting flight in Philadelphia. Do you un-delay your flights?
ridiculous how you want to charge me $209 to change flights even with multiple seats available on the flight I needed
@USAirways you can help by now finding my baggage!!  Reply to me ASAP with who I can direct details to.
.can you connect me to a person without having to wait 2+ hours on hold? I still haven't been able to resolve the problem.
Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
"Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline
@USAirways Easily the most ridiculous experience trying to spend money with your company.
"I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible."
it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
@USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville
is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
"flight from DC to LA, not to mention fix the circuit breaker in our bathrooms because this plane is as old as me..."
second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..
then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
Is large Wichita Falls Airport not receiving any arrivals? I have called and no one answers. I been waiting for 1 day
@USAirways what's wrong with the plane? Flt 581
@USAirways 9 empty seats open in 1st on AA1061. No upgrades for a U.S. Gold member? Would love consistent policies.
I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
"is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt"
I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
the flight I'm trying to change is in 4 hours and I've been trying to reach an agent for 72 now. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
and currently as im bringing my 3 year old to the bathroom I'm being rushed by the flight attendant.
oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
"thanks for the link, now finally arrived in Brussels, 9 h after schedule..."
I purchased Main Cabin XT for f-1571AUS. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and I was rescheduled on 1600 with regular seats. Credit?
@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
"@USAirways, 1st a reaccommodation, now a delayed flight for this one.  &amp; the Gate Agent still hasn't mumbled a word. Folks getting anxious."
Thanks for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
my bag is still in Miami and cannot be located?! How do you loose a bag like that? With a tag and everything?? (2)
 Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together.

@USAirways it is an extreme inconvenience to make ppl check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. You lie so you're not at fault
hi my flight to DFW 2463 was Cancelled Flightled tonight. Called in and left my number for call back it's been 3hrs please help.
nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face!
@USAirways I would appreciate a call regarding a HORRIBLE experience I had with a gate agent. Was on hold for 39 min and then hung on me.
she made it standby after her flight was Cancelled Flighted for no reason. Almost 4hrs Late Flight.  Conf# FVF9YW  SWRR# 298033455
and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
.yes and not boarding at 6:44. Good luck with that. Push wheels up to reality.  Dare you.
has no idea what they're doing. Delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another TO THE SAME DESTINATION  @ THE SAME TIME.
thnkx bt dont help now we will need to go WAY out of OUR way to get where we NEED to be for the $ u charge this sux #neveragain
"“@USAirways: @alan_bledsoe Thanks for your feedback, Alan.” Thx, but  no help as I watch a flt Lve w/open seats and I wait 3hrs for nxt flt"

is I can't make changes on the website am I still charged 25 dollars for using phone
@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
@USAirways site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX.
I am absolutely sick of 300s and no wifi!

@USAirways I keep getting hung up on. PLEASE respond so I can book a ticket with you. I won't be able to buy one unless I speak to someone!
since we are leaving tomorrow to miami can you do one thing right and deliver the bags to the airport?
@USAirways rebooked for Tuesday. Arriving too Late Flight for on Tuesday to start the class. Cancelled Flightled the trip.
"you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight for today and booked me for tomorrow, so unfortunately i have rebooked. Thanks"
@USAirways surely there are some other ways to help me - I can't really afford another 4 hours now. Pls follow me so we can DM
re-staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you.

@USAirways you denied a mom her AM flight because she NEEDED her breast pumping parts on a full flight? Please FIX this ASAP!! #freeflight
@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!
it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
@USAirways IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR???
"@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed"
I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
@USAirways - been on hold with reservations for over 30 min already! #worstairline
I have been on hold w/customer service line for 68 minutes.  This after I was on phone with an agent for 35 min b/f call droped
.@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.
"yes, last month when Boston got the first big snow storm and my flight was Cancelled Flightled."
Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?
we were on b6 619 this morning from Boston to beautiful San Diego. We really were bummed the satellite was broken. :(
any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We're at 20 minutes per person.

 Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
i sure hope you are able to get my bag to Memphis for tomorrow.would be nice to have some clean clothes for work.
"@USAirways , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!"

"@usairways RT @Dmoukdarath: Nice, another delay with @usair second one this trip. Left engine leaking...what's next?? #USAIR #nothappy"
The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks.
Cancelled Flightled flight from fresno then rebooked for LAX now flight Cancelled Flightled again and its midnight with no more hotel available???
why have you guys jacked up the prices AFTER you said prices were going to be lowered? SMH
I've tried ten times now last night and this morning...how many times should I try? Have meetings to make tonight in ATX.
@USAirways fuck you.

you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
I'll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means.

Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
" very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag..."
Spend 1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways .
"@USAirways Just discovered that they billed us $300 for the rescheduled flight, which cost me a second day of lost work."
1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
@USAirways Can you guys please give an update?  Been sitting on Tarmac on flight 601 yet the website still says it's on time?
Nashville airport has runways open. It appears southwest is only airline Cancelled Flighting flights. Is this likely to change?
- thanks. She submitted a damaged bag complaint online...is there anything else we can do? #goodcustomerservice
"I know. I’m sure you hear it all the time — don’t like the new seats. I’m a small guy, 5’ 6” and I feel the new planes are tight"
@USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough
"I am looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned."
I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
"yeah, buy me a plane ticket from San Diego to Detroit so I can fly one of their planes home tomorrow"
you guys need to educate your employees on what a pink tag is AND STOP LOSING MY GUITAR FOR THE 10 THOUSANDTH TIME!
boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
ask the 10 people you left behind at Miami airport because you guys could not wait 5 minutes and ... http://t.co/XPM98Igqjn
this is a big company should be happy to do something for a customer when now it's costing more for delays oh and did I mention
after a long wait of over an hour my mother's bag did not make it. We filed a report and are waiting. Thanks for your help
@CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
"I mean, your employees were really nice as I literally sobbed?"
"@USAirways but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief."
waited for 15 min then got disconnect
How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation?
@USAirways strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst
"I lost a day at the airport and off my trip, I should be compensated for the inconvenience!!!!!"
Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?
@USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.
I would purchase it if I was there by choice but you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight and have me stuck at DFW for 7 hours!
i wish i was flying @USAirways ... Cancelled Flightled our flights tomorrow and never notified us #FlyUS #Ripoff
"#AmericanAirlines 1 1/2 hr wait for bags. If this is the a taste of the worlds largest airline, heaven help aviation"
"@USAirways Website won't let me change online even though airline issued travel advisory, now on hold for 50 minutes. Help."
waiting 12 mins and counting to get through to Global Services....something going on?
and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
is flight 1318 Cancelled Flighted or not? No word from the ground staff.
 you are failing your customers because your check in process does not link to TSA pre-check.
customers ✅. Customer service ❌ http://t.co/qP6Aw3nLIP
so what's the solution?
it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
… But friendly efficient air attendants in coach #UA992 http://t.co/49pV3KcHNR
"yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though 😒 I'm really mad about the situation"
"but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy."
@USAirways never imagined it would be so hard to SPEND money through US Air. Stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone.
@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.
I was on hold for over 2 hours and my call got disconnected. Thanks a lot.
@USAirways if one with why can't you use American miles????
where's my damn bag??
good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
I don't want to be too whiny. We accommodated several passengers whose earlier flight was Cancelled Flightled. Our flight was very long.
@USAirways -- I've been on hold 40 mins to Cancelled Flight my reservation for this afternoon. Is there another way? Web tells me to call.
quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
@USAirways Has the most useless &amp; Rude employees ever at Philadelphia airport never again will I fly with them ! 😤

@USAirways Sitting in a cesspool of germs on the ground in #PHL for 2 hours now.
you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I'm delayed 10 hours now. What's my refund options?
"@united, fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better."
@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
@USAirways don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me
I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
today's wait was a violation of #dot #passengerbillofrights http://t.co/GxvFumn3iZ
you already have vomit so you are halfway there
@americanair thanks to your airline I now have a ruined bag and you refuse to do anything about it.

@RLDelahunty record l#oaaret got email we couldn't get rescheduled on another flight but don't know if flight is Cancelled Flightled
another week has passed and I hoped that I would have had a response by now
how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
"nonrefundable, hence I wrote $200! Doesn't make sense for my 150 credit. #nothanks"
"@USAirways worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it's ""not worth it"" for them accommodate me given circumstances in BOS"
cannot talk to any agents keep getting hung up on crazy
"@USAirways Never heard back, but this would help: Any chance I could bump up my flight time closer to 3pm today? I'm on flight 3960."

"@USAirways @AuroraBIZ check your bag, @PHLAirport bag handlers broke into my suitcase and stole my camera, bag was returned in a trash bag"
my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight?
@USAirways called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me?
I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
"Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united
@USAirways / don't forget without your customers you would be out of business! #epicfail #usairwaysfail
"I was insulted, disrespected and met with incompetence at every turn how about a voucher for a domestic round trip"
an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
"my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday early afternoon, so why did you call me at 1230am and 230am to wake me up and tell me?!"
I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time.
#poorservice #poorcommunication #waitingsince 10:51 for bags frm flight 424!!! #jetblue

"@USAirways 3+ hours on hold... oh, wait, for less than 5 minutes a useless CSR talked to me and put me back on hold for the last 30 minutes."

it wasn't ' disrupted' it was Cancelled Flightled. Airport agents were horrendous. Sharon was your saviour
"@USAirways wow.. Flight Cancelled Flightled, slept on the floor at the airport and now flight delayed"
this is not true. Gate agents 100% caused this. And we're not helpful. Thanks for making me miss connection!! http://t.co/xAIzW2isml
thats because you didnt read my entire tweet. Wife's 12pm flight is now delayed to 6:30.  Thats 3 6+ hour flight delays in 2 weeks
@nrosenb1 it says changes can't be made online
well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
"#1687 MDW-SAN. Like most flights, if I'm watching free TV it works but won't hardly access any websites - including your own."
"unfortunately, that doesn't help. Just an automated computer."
40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
"@USAirways No reFlight Booking Problems necessary. I can't afford to deal this kind of unprofessionalism again. I would, however, like some type of credit."
thanks for the response. I know it's not your fault... But Im in ORD in T5 and hungry if you want to stop by ✈️✌️
"yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
i need help but in spanish
"Thanks, but that results in missing the conference I'm attending. Are there options to book earlier,or if not,receive a refund?"

@USAirways something is wrong with your phone system if you call someone and don't play the recorded flight notification. Is US643 Late Flight?
@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
@SouthwestAir- is new #MKT strategy to be average like all the rest? #whathappend? RR Points Devalued- AGAIN -http://t.co/mDbDYomrs7
what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
"- So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don't care about their safety?"
@USAirways you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done
just DM'd
fuck you for not caring 😢
"Also, I have to wait more than 2 hours before I can speak to someone on the phone?  I can't wait 2 hours.  :("
DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat
The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
"I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest"
Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcKs2bh5

Thanks. “@USAirways: @fispahani Weather disruptions have caused some of our crew to run Late Flight. We're sorry for the delay to your flight.”
my sister and her family had to drive 1200 miles because you did not accommodate a rebook in a timely manner! HORRIBLE
Been on hold for over an hour - any chance someone can help me on here?
- trying to fly from BOS to JFK. Flight delayed. Traveling with kids. Book a hotel or are we getting out tonight?
"flight 2470 tomorrow, have no idea if we've been rescheduled and can't fix online? Have to talk to an agent yet no one answers?"
well if you don't want your customers to be frustrated compensate them appropriately when you screw up royally!! #fakesincerity
you're terrible.

@USAirways how does that help me when I get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks
@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest
@USAirways Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #SmoothOperation
Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you'd have less issues #justsaying
@USAirways I got up at 2 am for a 5 am flight from bos to Charlotte which I found was Cancelled Flightled once I got to the gate (1)
@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.

"no announcement re extra baggage, ""find an empty bin"" down to aisle 20 back up with baggage to my seat row 7. YOUR agents argueing"
have such a bad rep for loosing costumers luggage. I stopped flying them a while back.
"not the case. Now delayed due to ""mechanical issues with no update on departure time"". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta"
@USAirways we're all standing here and no one is saying anything. I'll most likely be missing my flight to BWI AGAIN. http://t.co/JhaU4K48yv
by far the best example of the worst company @Cowboycerrone
why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH

@USAirways yesterday we were delayed for SIX hours w/lil to NO explanation we paid LOTS of $$ 2 fly w/u &amp; this is how u treat ur customers?

"Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!"
"By ""answering as fast as they can"", you mean hanging up on every call?"
outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first

I want to speak to a human being! !!  This is not an obscene request!
@travisamex please please American call me so I can rebook ticket .
"Yep, still waiting for bags at #JFK. What's the holdup? Looks like we are the only flight that got in at this time..??"
@southwestAir SWA agent Jacquie Plitt @Orangecounty SNA rudely tells me You're not going 2 CABO today or manana back 2 PHX flew @USAirways

Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
"@USAirways - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account."

@USAirways You should be prepared for Weather. All I want to do is find out if I can take train to PHL to catch my connection.
DONT LOSE MY LUGGAGE!!!
 flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
is by far THE WORST airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I've flown to!!! It's outrageous!
not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
"@USAirways your customer service is a joke. First a mechanical Cancelled Flightation, now weather. On hold since 5:30 am. No humans. Pls call me!"

"extremely frustrating travel experience in Denver! Instead of landing in SEA on Saturday, now it's Monday afternoon!"
@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.
your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
is there any estimate on when the holding for you online will end? I'm at an hour and forty minutes now. I need to rebook!!!
"really this is getting worse as the day goes on. Late Flight leaving then had to be diverted, and now sitting on the tarmac in VA."

you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
"@USAirways ""Able""? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?"
@usairways I just learned that although there is travel policy and they waive the change fee-you will still be charged a $25 reservation fee
why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?

@USAirways  please don't go to the check in process uses at #MCO. It's an absolute disaster.
I spoke to soon... My bag was lost.. :(
@USAirways all these planes sitting here and no one going home. #usairwaysfail http://t.co/jN3V3k3qGv
.we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
been on hold for an hour. I need to rebook my flight that was Cancelled Flighted! #help
Took a flight yesterday fron TPA-DFW-AUS. Bag went to IAH. Today bag went to IAH-DFW and then back to IAH. Still no bag!
@USAirways I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min
Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
"@USAirways I sympathize re:weather issues, but when times get tough, call in more folks. Over two hours on hold for 4-minute fix. #FAIL"
@USAirways now my rebooked connection is delayed.
I figured the streaming wouldn't work per the TOS but just the @NASCAR site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load
terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
"@timbennettg3 @USAirways Cancelled Flightled 4532 sch departure 8:38 am, wasn't snowing yet and other flights were still leaving #Fail"
@USAirways I had to sit in your kitchen and move stuff around so I had what I needed. I'm extremely disappointed in your service
@united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver
"I'm disappointed my flight was Cancelled Flighted, mostly because I was excited to listen to the song ""I'm Blue"" while flying on JetBlue."
"poor storm customer service, 1hr takeoff delay waiting for the snack cart, rude steward (no names) and I love you guys. #TrueBlue"
why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
I filled out that whole form before receiving a poor poor response. Is there no direct email address in reply?
@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
"I'll be sticking with @southwest in the future. No change fees, first bag free, and stellar customer service."
Why did you interupt the Staduim Series on @NHLonNBCSports. I dont need to see your stupid commercials or Emergency. Info.
@USAirways how is your gate agent gonna tell me my flight is on time when its 5 minutes past departure time and the previous flights plane..
@USAirways they weren't able to without reFlight Booking Problems and recharging the amount plus $25 fee for help over phone. Spoke to 2 agents &amp; Jeanine
WiFi on yesterday's flight extremely slow a waste of $8 and lost the travel time for work.
exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
 many have missed connections already b/c of delayed flight which will finally board soon
"= WORST. Booked in Oct. w/ email confirm &amp; NEVER INFORMED Cancelled Flightlation. Instructed ""to mail written letter"" http://t.co/c7Kzbvf8h8"
is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money?
we are well aware. Insufficient info. No options.
"What's with the pricing cache?! About to book a flight, refreshed the page, &amp; the price jumped from $73 to $159. Ridiculous. 😑"
contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
"I have sent the DM, should I continue to wait on hold with a rep, or will you be servicing me here?"
I miss the Continental days.
"of the airplane otherwise they would call the Police, because the flight had to take off before 12h30am"
@USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail
with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
your agents at IAD have compounded this problem by not making any announcements #jetbluemess
@USAirways you've completely ruined a pro athlete's ability to prepare for a race. Now you won't help him get the bike he needs to the DR?!
"@USAirways sorry, I meant flight 4420, which was supposed to depart at 5:00, now says 6:30. What is the issue?"
@USAirways link doesn't work and I've tried tracking my bag several times. Still doesn't clarify where it is.
BUT just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines
@Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
Ruth was VERY helpful in re-routing us to Punta Cana when Dulles connection failed. Other reps- NOT so helpful.
"delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to New York, this is disgraceful"
thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
last trip on ... Poor customer service 3 trips in a row! here I come!
" when do you anticipate decisions for Cancelled Flightlations at DFW tomorrow morning? Need to rearrange hotel reservations, etc. ASAP!"
"@SeguineJ AA - this is a joke, right? That line isn't even accepting calls right now - they just hang up."
@USAirways #stuck in Florida with no flights... Service sucks here. #nofood #nodrinks #nohelp
thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail
@USAirways instead of tweeting your customers apologizing why don't you pick up your phone
@USAirways Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility
"the first place but I really didn't need the extra stress at this already terrible time. Oh by the way, I made the flight with 30"
"really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address."
"@USAirways cust svc means nothing! So disappointed. Trying since 730a to speak to a human I get bad weather not bad service
@USAirways I've been on hold for over 90 minutes... There's a lack of quality service here.  Nobody cares that I hate your shitty airline.
is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be.
Pls help. On hold 4 long time now. Travelling 4 business and flight 2 ORF from MCI was Cancelled Flightled.  Need to get out there ASAP.
if you guys fuck this up again  I will never forgive you
narrowly made standby...lots of snags this trip!
20 HS students from Ithaca NY stuck in Miami flts xld u won't rebook to get kids home use carrier alliance #rulesshouldbend

"@USAirways the two women workng PHL bag check term C @ 11:30 ET should be fired for being rude, pushy and treating customers with disrespect"
Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly ever again ..
@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
is 4:30am and I am in the customer service line trying not to scream. #epicfailunited
 of course this morning I see a non-stop from IAH to SFO but that was not available yesterday. #UnitedHatesUsAll
"the internet is a great thing.  I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner."
"@usairways If I could/wanted to call I wouldn't use the internet to make a reservation
that's a crazy long form! You need something other than a video?
"We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour's wait. No apologies, no explanation."
@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
"shout out to the crew on flight 89 headed back to the big apple, they kept my glass half full the whole flight! #jetbluejfk"
"your A-list program is a complete JOKE! Your company does not value loyal customers.Time to look for another ""go-to"" airliner"
@USAirways is flt 680 en route to DCA or BWI after diverting to RDU. Your phone service  sucks and your website is conflicting.
What is going on with the flight from Buffalo to JFK? Have they figured anything out about the temperature and the tower yet?
no date on when revieving our money sent a letter in post and several emails no reply?? very frustrated
Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
@USAirways @JosephTReis Can't believe advice to call customer service. I was on hold for 3 hrs this morning and finally gave up.
@USAirways How dirty does the damn plane have to be to take an hour to get the plane cleaned??? Refund me my miles😡. #wasteoftime #theworst

"Ok. We will probably Cancelled Flight our flights then, take a refund, and get home another way. Wednesday won't work for us."
why haven't you updated that flight 4411 is delayed? Super frustrating
"on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?"
@USAirways but in the meantime I'll be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st.  Thanks guys!
flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting

"unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you"
@usairways the. Worst. Ever. #dca #customerservice
@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
@abigailedge Another glitch??
 is the website down?
14 hours after landing in #ATL &amp; I still do not have my bags...which means no clothes or makeup!!! #UnitedAirlines #nothappy
@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
"I have used you guys for most my travels, but this last experience I will never use southwest again! #worstcustomerservice"
@USAirways ...these changes as well to Late Flightr find out that the flight I was scheduled for isn't ready

"backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!"
"Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you?"

"@USAirways Best part was hearing the attendant give a voucher to person next to me for hotel at BGR. Then my guy saying ""we don't do that"""
you got me home over an hour and a half Late Flight but at least my baggage was delivered soaking wet
@USAirways yes. But the manner with which it was done was harsh for those affected. Already checked in. No remorse. Weak alternatives.
how about an update on flight 475 leaving tf green delayed
@usairways I've been on hold for approaching 2 hrs for an issue when I changed my ticket online. Frustrating.
@USAirways now on hold for 75 minutes.
Are there really no flights from the Bay Area to Chicago anymore? Lame. So lame.
@USAirways is useless airways. Day 2 trying to get home on standby as a result of their Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways
you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
"@USAirways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help."
On hold for 20 mins and then used the call back service only to have an agent call me and put me on hold forever-anyone there?
Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
"I need help with a reservation purchased on but operated on @USAirways, can't get through on the 800#"
how long does it take for a bag to get to the baggage belt!!!!!#toolong of a wait

I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain
@KyleJudah I just spoke to the baggage claim center and they gave me travel credit but will not be responsible for the cost of a

"prove it, Cuz the southwest people here don't even know why it's behind schedule."
Conference begins in 3 hours. Up all night due to delays and still waiting to talk to someone about lost luggage.
"@USAirways my wife is trying to check in for a flight tonight out of RSW...website not allowing, saying must go to airport... [Part 1 of 2]"

"Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out."
"not sure what this means but son and I will certainly have operational needs for seats during Flt. 1679 next Friday, yet..."
You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2
"When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ."

ill call in the morning. too upset right now.
"really hoping to get some help here.  On my 5th attempt to get a resolution, and lost count of transfers.  help please! #mileageplus"
I was told I had a 20minute wait time after waiting hours. And an hour has gone by. This is ridiculous
@USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx
I get Sunday due to weather and ok Monday they're busy but this is crazy
@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless
OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It's getting real old real quick!!
@USAirways my friends are stranded at KPHL and the representatives there won't even give them food vouchers…any help please?
"also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
@USAirways This is the last time I use your airline. I promise that!
"I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home."
@USAirways quit being cheap and hire some call center employees. It shouldn't take half a day to call you
I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
the big board says we aren't leaving until after 8:30 😩
"@USAirways Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number."
was wondering is there a reason why customer service is so busy? Been on hold past few days for many hours No answer Help plz
no more than half an hour wait. It's unreal. Finally first bag coming out. SJU needs to work on this
4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir

she should not only get a refund but also an apology for the deplorable service.
@USAirways NOT GOOD. been on hold for 1hour (2x/day) since sun. to book 1-way flt dividend miles. agents send me to on hold hell. #furious
"@USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would."
thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.
I certainly hope my LA /PBI on 25 th has a NEW plane . The seats on Feb 11 th flight ( in reverse) God awful
service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
"is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,"
you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
"I'm trying my hardest to not get frustrated, but I am getting no response on email or by phone. AA owes me $500. How do I claim"
is there not an email address I can send my issue to? you guys screwed up and rebooked my flight to the wrong day!  please help
"Not good enough. No info communicated at any point - just silence. for hours as we sat. Oh, and then seat was broken. #worst"
$55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
@USAirways @joyadventuremom there are breastfeeding momma's watching this story all over the country! Better work on a faster response :)
@USAirways tried twice today on hold for 30 min each time. i have things to do so can't live on hold dealing w/ your customer serv failures
I have had 4 flights Cancelled Flightled through yall!!!! Im sick of it 😠😠
"Disappointed,UNITED did NOT feed small CHILDREN on a 5 &amp; half hour flight (Honolulu to Los Angeles), Appalling, ESP food waspaid for"
@USAirways I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight
I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
WHAT'S UP WITH WEBSITE CAN'T ACCESS FLIGHT INFO
are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??
2nd flight in two weeks that you have lost my bag!  Taking my 1K status to #neveragain #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
i've now been in France two days without changing clothes and nothing to keep me warm so please locate my bag and send it to(4)
the ticket is a poor gesture of goodwill (for missed trip) to a top status flyer - I may not next time (AA91 LHR-ORD 2/16)
@USAirways no one is coming to line. On hold for 4 hours. Can u help here if I provide conf code?
@amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/
"@usairways on hold for TWO HOURS now, pick up the PHONEEEEE"
"please fix your inventory system, Plat upgraded then bumped DOWN after boarding, FA said they made a mistake. AA45 3A➡️8C 😕"
@USAirways I'm a chairman who was in 1st class on both my flights today. System Cancelled Flightled my tickets and kicked me out of 1st.
"Flight for tomorrow has already been Cancelled Flightled, what do I do now?"
no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
"because of the horrific flight experience, you guys have made me NEVER want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!!"
Every flight flown by me personally(about two round trips per month) is FULL. Still hard to believe. Fly 8 hours thru ATL?NO
is the worst airline in the world.
you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
I'm trying to choose my seats but every time I go to the next flight I get system error
another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
"Booked 6mos early, paid for Early check in, was ASSIGNED boarding #, here 3hrs early and you deleted me in error?! #LAS2BUF"
@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short
are the miles going to be restructured? Help a silver status brotha out! I thought I was winning with you guys until today lol
u didn't give an answer why the flight delayed so long. and how do u compensate missing my other flights Lima to Cuzco??
really
my first flight ever and flight #4251 is already having technical issues. Faaaannntastic.😭
"This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
"Cancelled Flighted flights, now I'm rerouted and have over 12 hrs of travel but you will bump paying customers for non revs. #custserv"
how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been..
they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
thanks for the apology. Unfortunately i have had one too many bad experiences and will no longer be flying with southwest.
Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items
there are no more flights via united when I arrive to DFW and my car is parked at IAH 😁
"Been on hold on the phone for well over half an hour, waiting to make a reservation change I *wanted* to make online. Help!"
"even when I did get through, no one knew anything about my bag. This is ridiculous, I still don't have my bag from Saturday."
"any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update."
"used to love you, but you keep rescheduling my flights.  #southworst"
day 3 of this Saga maybe they'll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days #badservice
"""bag has not yet been located"". Again, 5th time I've checked it. How can tracking my bag be this hard for your system?"
"@USAirways   US AIRWAYS DON'T CARE FOR CUSTOMERS. Worst experience today with US airways.. Myself, wife and toddler"
Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.
sounding like they just got bitch-slapped by @juliasinton948
Yes but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma
thanks for the canned reply.
Sir. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/F5IXyw8XyB
"No! We departed 24 hours Late Flightr, with a crazy crew. One of the lady simply freaked out and got away from job before departure."
@USAirways you have the ability to switch my flight to but you cannot tell me where my bags are.
Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not.
"@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody..."
you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn't want to wait their turn can get a slip?
finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
your airline has been telling me that my luggage is one hour away from my destination for 5 days!
As it always is. Helps to communicate to customers.
"@USAirways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying.."
"assistance with what, the attitude of your staff no matter which airport we are at?"
not making a great first impression on my first flight. 20 minutes before boarding and the gate agent still can't assign me a seat?
"do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check"
thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks!
 started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me.
@USAirways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this long😒
didn't get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard...
@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
@USAirways are you going to do anything to help stranded travelers of flight 680?! No communication from anyone. All of us dumped here.
please refund my ticket. What a terrible experience. #southwestfail
"and a complete lack of faith in your companies. It's really a shame that you think telling me ""it's been a challenging"""
i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
some woman gets on plane and holds 2 seats in the bulkhead for her friends with C boarding passes. I paid $ earlybird thx
@USAirways has the WORST customer service and their flights are always delayed
ouch not fair
already missed connection... UA 495
how do you expect to do that?
please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection
@usairways  this is ridiculous at CLT  and we missed our connecting flight because of a chuckhole  on runway??  #shameful (1/1)
Why doesn't allow for conversations between upset customers and their customer service?  #worstcustomerserviceever
@USAirways I been on hold with U for 40mins wasting my time and $ &amp; I don't appreciate it #WheresTheCustomerServiceAt http://t.co/phI2IfNjIT
@USAirways what is policy on changing flight to different dates once your flight has been delayed?
"I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."
@USAirways thanks 4 making it impossibly expensive 2 change 2 a flight leaving less than 24 hrs earlier than my reservation #1lesscustomer
How about auto check in for CP holders? Come on.
@USAirways took me 4+ hours to book flights yesterday due to system errors between you and @AmericanAir. paid $320 extra due to time lapse
@USAirways or is anyone even responding to social media? AWFUL.
 Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again!
worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation
16 days for one flight and 8 for the other (roundtrip).
ROC flight Cancelled Flightled. Love my snowy drive home with no useful substitutes
"why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!"
"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
"@JetBlue, I normally ❤️ you, but this Late Flightst flight experience was the worst. 2 hours on runway, no wifi &amp; tv not working properly"
third JetBlue flight in less than a week. All Late Flight not for weather.  Reliability going downhill.
"@USAirways so i ask for ice and the attendant snaps ""i dont have ice on this cart"" not 5 min Late Flightr 2 cups of ice to the people 2 rows ahead."
"@USAirways Wife and I flew to Italy recently. Bought tickets via Finnair, flights operated by USAir. Didn't get dividend miles credited."
👍. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;)
"flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today!"
@USAirways I made a reservation online but I didn't receive any confirmation email. My bank said the transaction went through. Can u help?
Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
"@USAirways Raleigh to Chicago and no #firstclass upgrade. Must be flying AA 'the screw USAir Elite, after we bailed them out' Airline"
that's where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. @delta help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO?
Do less please @JetBlue
"@PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs"
worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.
"has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how ""wifi is coming!"" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw"
they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.
hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
- SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security?
"not sure why we are still here in Dallas.  Plane has been at gate for 30 min.  No update at all.  Flight 1140, poor service."
@USAirways left us. had to stay on other flight until they got bags off. This sucks. Had to run with a baby and bags!
I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
@USAirways Ten hrs Late Flightr and still here on Army cots @ airport waiting for 11am flight. #poorlyhandled #usairheads http://t.co/18fMr06mn6
"@USAirways comedy of errors continues..."" We can't get into our gate, there is a broken down truck in the way"" #fail"
because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
needs to get its act together in #PHX
@USAirways going to miss my connection because my flight home has been delayed and now no gate agent to get us off the plane-so frustrated
why are you making me stay in JFK until 2 am or Late Flightr? Just let me rebook without making me pay more
@USAirways and now that flight pushed back to 2:35pm departure.
check on what? Our broken tablet! See attached picture. #media #filmcrew #nbc #cnn http://t.co/Uq2ooPjPwg
" We're on flight 910 Vegas to Boston today, checked in online but our bag count didn't register. Can I fix that somehow?"
yes but not with much help from you guys
 already contacted Central Baggage &amp; sent DM. @RenttheRunway is charging me for the dress that was in the lost suitcase #help
horrible flight!
at LAX and your service reps just hand out the 800 number to call. So that's not helpful.
All flights are booked . They are saying I have to wait until tomorrow.
@USAirways too Late Flight.
"@USAirways flights &amp; ""customer relations"" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE"
 Do you guys know your check-in links from emails are broken? http://t.co/2npXB6oBMr
@USAirways our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating!
Trying desperately to get my boyfriend booked on the same US Airways flight as myself for the same price. Can you help?
Rapid Rewards program sold me short. #Lasttweetaboutthis but still #disappointed.
"Last thing I want to deal w/ before 8 on a Mon! I've already waited the suggested wait time, so I hope I get a call back ASAP."
pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
why are we delayed :( flight 1601
 your website sucks donkey dicks. Just thought you should know. All best.
@USAirways you guys straight up suck ass
Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
still waiting on a dm response..... #sloooowresponses
now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
loses my luggage and @hotelstonight loses my reservation. after a 10 hour travel day. I just want to get to @StartingBloc in the am!
no. Please stop.
what can AA do for a load of people about to board their 5th plane of a very long day when the first 4 were unserviceable
flighted delayed for hours. 10pm arrival to Vegas is now 4am. Did you seriously lose my luggage???
a week after Valentines day..not feeling the #LUV. Going on 11 hrs @BWI and don't my bags aren't even coming w me.
@USAirways Can you advise on what's happening with departure delays from CLT?
"That's still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day."
@USAirways you have got to be kidding me!  No info on 4565 from DCA to BGR and your phone line tells me to call back Late Flightr?
@USAirways I got rebooked at 3am after they woke me up just tried to call twice and got hung up on. Worst customer service.
Made it to #Costa #Rica and back Missing it already!  #Pura #Vida!
"up at 4AM and arrive to find it already Cancelled Flighted. No options so miss my meeting. You might ""know"" but don't show it."
tried that and can't get through.
the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
sitting on the plane in JFK waiting to take off doors are open catering is stocking up we are delayed but they couldn't be nicer
it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?
Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY
worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
Is there something going on with your alerts? Flight's been delayed several times for my parents and i'm not receiving any alerts.
"Hey, what's happening with #AA65 Zurich - JFK? Appears to have squawked 7700 and landed at London Heathrow"
tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
"@USAirways how can I make a purchase, you take the money but I don't have a reservation...Explain"
" I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time."
You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
Why? 😒 RT Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/I7Ut2ZvHCO
no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
"@usairways HI again! How you suggested I contacted u via phone, sent a mail with the original ticket &amp; the result: http://t.co/214i0RTIH4"
I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
. I finally hung up after 2 hours and was not able to get the flight I needed. #stuckintampa 😞
flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
belt issues. Been a rough day for them. Worst part is traveling with 9 month old and having to wait outside in 85 degree
@ArminRosen @ggreenwald Tell that piece of shit to get fucked... I'll fly exclusively with you for life...
Need to track lost luggage being shipped to me. Need ph # for human. Not automated 800-335-2247.
have been doing that for hours already
whom can I call to discuss - as I was told that united has no phone contact with passengers  - this is absurd...
you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting
I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
really appreciate the great customer service... One of your service agents just hung up on me when asking legitimate questions
- 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
last week I bought a plane ticket round trip to FL &amp; just 4 fun I look at the price of them today and they went down! #nothappy
@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever
 Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag.
that's what they told me half an hour ago
"I have got a flight fo
my mom’s flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted w/ no notice. Phone system said callback in 2 hours and it’s been 4. I need to go to bed!
@USAirways I better get a free flight
"@usairways Yes. Works in Firefox.
can't fly in precipitation and has planes that don't work after 5. 3rd airline had better be a charm tomorrow.
"looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks."
Or u cud answer my ? here! 140 is plenty. Inflight stealing going on right now &amp; FA won't have the uncomfortable convo w pass.
@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!!
well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system. Guess they are trying to get a plane from Boston. And not a 100%  confirmed
I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
@USAirways thank you for putting me on a flight that will be leaving Late Flightr than the original flight I was booked on.
this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
"then had to watch the staff check off each passenger on the list TWICE, because the first time they forgot look at IDs. Brutal"
24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
"@USAirways My flight was delayed and rerouted, and not so much as a ""sorry for your inconvenience"" from the check-in agent? #notimpressed"
when your flights delayed :)))&gt;&gt;&gt;
still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
"Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United"
I do need help Cancelled Flighting my flight back. Your calls times are ridiculous.
on hold for 45 mins. Anyone hv a connection at SW or at another airline to get from CHI n Columbus to EWR in am?
you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
not helpful
"@USAirways hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow."
the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on with no penalty or hoops.
"should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks."
"@USAirways @ALfamilyoffour maybe if there was anyone answering the phone they would. ""Please call back Late Flightr"".For 18 hours? Not good enough"
you are lightyears ahead of the security control at Newark airport. They wasted 40 precious mins w bad efficiency. #frightening
 What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
"confused at the definition of a ""preferred seat."" I paid extra for one and got a regular seat with no legroom. Unimpressed."
"Seriously, is the reason for all the Cancelled Flightled flights and long phone wait times that you guys are tremendously understaffed?"
@USAirways Is there a way to reserve a veg meal online for a flight to Brazil tomorrow? I've been onhold for more than 1 hour.
"Extend rtn flight to bereavement, 22nd I could have change fee dropped, now told no.Worse day of my life #badcustomerservice"
 amazing to me that we can't get any cold air from the vents. #VX358 #noair #worstflightever #roasted #SFOtoBOS
@USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them
"@USAirways Forget reservations. Thank you to the great leadership at your company, I've Cancelled Flighted my flight. Once again, thank you."
no I don't. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw
I need to change a ticket and my res can't be changed online.  I also can't get a call through due to high volume--can u help?
really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
"now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter"
been on hold so long to rebook my Cancelled Flightled flight I had enough time to rebook with @USAirways instead! Lots of room there!
"@JetBlue, your hold music sucks."
I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.
@USAirways you are horrendous.  Pull your shit together
pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?
"@SouthwestAir, on #unscheduled aircraft change, please have a better system in place, not worth the paid upgrade. #REFUND"
"Okay, I think 1565 has waited long enough for a gate at DFW..."
it would be nice if I could talk to an agent rather than get caught up w/ a promotion &amp; then be hung up on
@USAirways You have no idea how upset and frustrated I am right now. I'll be sure to follow through with never flying with you again.
searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
@USAirways On hold for an hour...connected to the wrong department by your automated system...transferred and now another 45 min &amp; counting
"you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor."
@USAirways congrats on treating your customers the worst way possible. I know plenty of other ppl who have had horrible experience w you too
No. We were in a large group. Majority of the 30+ bags were soaked.
@USAirways But every time I call I'm on hold for 45 min and then get disconnected. Any way someone can help?
When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
@USAirways #DividendRewards Urgently need to speak with a CS rep. My 50K miles havent shown &amp; I've fulfilled all reqs. Flight Booking Problems flights today

no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
@USAirways I need an actual person in customer relations for a refund. What # can I call? I will dispute this charge on my credit card.
Any ETD for SWA1004 from PHL? Appears delayed but no info available at gate.
@USAirways I waited customer service 32 minutes on the phone w/o response. Had to hung up in the end since my battery died due to waiting!
@USAirways hire smarter IT people if your systems keep crashing instead of some of the mooks you man some of these airports with. #goDelta
@USAirways why I can't book a flight to PRN through your website?
@USAirways Know what I like about gate 35X @NationalAirpor ? Nothin.I like nothin bout yo #ghettofab gate #USAirways http://t.co/mAqw2nLNiU
@USAirways next time you promise an ontime departure you should stick to it instead of stuffing us in this sweat box with no air
I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
"yes, very much so! I was looking forward to using your airlines for future flights but never again."
 @ChrysiChrysic your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you!
what are my chances of making a connection to El Paso (AA504) with DFW from SAT (AA200) delayed 30 minutes?
"says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The ""weather"" didn't affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx"
@USAirways I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can't get through.  You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use!
"@USAirways @msscottwg  ""That's unusual"" means we screwed up but will never admit to it!  #GoingForGreatnessFAIL"
very poor customer service thru out each of my cxl flights😔 I should've flew @Delta
"where are our pilots? Plane is here flight says it's still on time, but we should of been off the ground 15 minutes ago."
then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
".I appreciate that, and not to be rude, but it doesn't solve much. You should AT LEAST cover the cost of stolen goods."
we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service
can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
thx for responding. I cant watch 2 mins of this film w/out it cutting in and out 4 prolonged prds of time. beyond frustrating
TSA said there is nothing they could do. But the question is why are your employee's swapping your customers belongings?
@jetblue had me on hold foreverrrrrr
@USAirways on the phone over an hour waiting for customer service  got wrong fight information cost us 6 hours from trip. Frustrating!!!

"2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I'm back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost"

"@USAirways suggest you failures make a HUGE donation to @the_USO  Charlotte, NC as THEY provided GREAT customer service today, unlike you."
@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
"Supervisor M.Robinson just served a lot of attitude, Cancelled Flighted my flight out of spite, then put me back on on #crazybitch"
its not weather thats why i said the other people received hotel rooms while the people at the end of the line did not get them
working over time tonight?  Got delayed 2 days .. In SJU .. Could be worse :)
 flight 404 delayed 2 hours in LA due to mechanical problems. Handle like pros but you could have tossed us a free drink.
you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
"Why doesn't anyone make a better effort to retain customers. It should be an easy fix, I just want to travel AA."
@USAirways hello??? Anyone there?
Not helping since there's a bunch of us trying to get off at the same time.
has it been 4-6hrs yet?
this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
@USAirways 8 weeks to refund this ticket - 0372389047497?!? - totally unacceptable.  Fix this or I'll put it on blast on social media and TV
"Changed flight from BNA to 2/20 ahead of weather. Slammed me with cost diff because ""no weather advisory.""Really!"
"Not only was 5418 Late Flight, but we've been boarded and waiting for over 30min. WTF?"
"@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical."
no one has answers...no one can help. There is always a different story to why my and my fiancee' can't be helped.
my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...
so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
your seats are god awful.
turned my non-stop flight between Laguardia/dal into a 1 stop in STL. WTH? I'm thinking some sorta comp is in order? REALLY?
are you kidding me?  No one answering calls on reserv line due to high call volume and not even an option to wait.  Brutal
now our pilots timed out...#getmeoutofhere
@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
"you know I love this airline, but why are my friends @MEGENTRIPODI @jordnnicole7 having such a problem retaining info they need"
"4/9/14, I need to fly from GSP to DSM, but claims there's no sched. avail.  I can book separately, but why not together?"

I'm trying to add my 2012 flights to my Badges account but i don't see an option. Help plz?

@USAirways is the @comcast of airlines #2hrs35minOnHold
@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
bag just delivered and items have been stolen.  At first look - my Kate spade bag and bottle of spiced rum!  Wtf!!
has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument.
it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
I'm sitting on the plane. Too many predictable mechanical problems.  Still onboard. This is getting bad...
we will not be flying with you or US air again. The changes and Cancelled Flightations leading up to today's big finale is unacceptable.
 is the worst airline to ever travel with!!!! The worst!! They're equivalent to DIRT!!!!!!
@USAirways over two hours on hold to talk to an agent..then it disconnects me.  been trying for two days! Wtf! Hire some CSRs u make $ now
your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time.
your wifi is a lie and i hate you
the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293

@USAirways why now just announce delay of 4478 from PVD when you knew captain was already on delayed flight coming in? Frustrating
have u seen any of the messages the past hour ?
because your plane's toilet wasn't working and they needed gas. This is flight 1081 leaving Dulles going to LAX. Do some...
@USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you.
"unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes ""like every 15 minutes."" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?"
never got any notification that flight 955 was Cancelled Flighted today. Correct phone # and email on file. Not a happy customer.
if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?

absolutely worse cust. Svc ever experienced in 25 yrs of flying.  Supvrs at iah extremely rude. #poorservice #travel

"lies,lies,lies.  Worst travel experience of my life. Day 2 no clothes on vaca.  #lostluggage #unprofessional #pit #mia"
@USAirways I don't know I've tried to call for confirmation but calls aren't going thru. Can you let me know?
@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
@USAirways When I check online it states status closed. What does this mean? As I have yet been able to reach a live person...
thanks for reFlight Booking Problems me on a flight and then leaving my luggage in NYC. Unbelievable.
"you do a great job of achieving that at most cities, just not at BWI."
ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?

never again.
Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?
"- handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still @ layover airport.Have that ref # tho."
"Flt 463 San Jose, CA -&gt; Denver, CO. Delayed 2 hrs but easily best flight + touchdown in all my years flying. Keep it up!"
uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
...and when that doesn't work...
@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
"your DCA baggage claim employees should realize a please, a thank you and an apology can go a long way #customerservice #DCA"
768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives?

thanks! More concerned about the conflicting texts I was receiving my about my flight  Having to drive 10 hours now 😢
why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight
or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled!

"hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8"" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports."
@USAirways freaking out about the fact you are fixing the engine from Charlotte to Orlando. #longday
@USAirways forgot to call in the copilot so we're stuck on the plane in PHL. Looking fwd to being stranded in CLT. Day 2 of flight fails.
"@united's first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks."
thank you! Hopefully it's soon! We are supposed to leave at 11:23
@USAirways  well its 11:45am and just got an email that my 11am flight is delayed-thats not right
@USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight.
@USAirways your customer service stinks. Trying to book a flight for hours now and keep getting hung up on. #usairwayssucks
car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait
"@USAirways flights keep getting delayed and Cancelled Flighted with no information, worst customer service ever."
this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.
you are a bunch of liars! Cancelled Flightled our flight and rebooked us four days Late Flightr!
"@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?"
sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
"Totally sucks that my flights were weathered out of existence, but Stacy in Tucson helped with an overnight in Vegas!"
On flight 1712 to Houston delayed duecto engine trouble. Willl you hold my connection to Argentina at Houston since I'm Late Flight now?
the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
"@united, wtf is your username and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday"
flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
- Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
"- 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process."
Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
"@USAirways on hold for 1hr, 30min. Not willing to hang in there as long as @franchise02. answered in 7 min. U are not 1 yet."
there really should not be guidance to call via phone if you are that back logged. I could have done it online in 3 minutes.
"the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors."
how do you NOT do maintenance on #MD80 while it sits for two days? Frozen lines found after its boarded? Come on! #faail #mci

@americanair Can someone contact me about my awful experience with american airlines this weekend
flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
@USAirways 1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled.
"- tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??"

@southwestair on flight 3130 and I paid $8 for wifi that can't load a website functionally except for your own live streaming. Unacceptable.

no news here at the gate. What are my options?
you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
"@USAirways delayed my flight 3 times before Cancelled Flighting it, had angry and rude workers, and are now providing no helpful service at all"
you really should be more proactive with passengers when you know the entertainment system isn't working. At least let me get a mag
not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You've ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation.
why are there so many delays to north east cities?
.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
"@usairways It was 9º, and some of us had left coats in our luggage in anticipation of cramped overhead bins :|"

WHERE IS MY BAG?!?!?!
I like delays less than you because I'm the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher
the reservation system won't even let us leave our phone #. I have no way to fix that you rebooked me on wrong day!
@USAirways I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me
now you're sending a gate agent to talk to us? Joke of an airline. Thanks for ruining my vacation. #neverflyAAagain
"that would be appreciated. Just please don't send me to the same page with long form &amp; limited characters
"still no reply to my email sent on 11th February. Even sent an email asking for acknowledgment that's it been recieved, nothing"
@USAirways I think it's a little weak sauce you have zero inflight entertainment for a 4 hour flight from Salt Lake to Philadelphia
once again my flight is delayed. I hope I dont miss my  connecting. Please don't fuck me... I have a girlfriend -_-
@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad

@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
"- Appreciate your system is busy but when I call, having your automated system hang up on me is not helpful."
hasn't evennotified us that theflight isdelayed via email/text/phone call.If we wererunning Late Flight I would be pissed #unreliable
all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @burningman ticket instead. &amp; ill be driving there not flying
"@SouthwestAir, got ""duped"" w/ a connection on 1st flight (sneaky), now u won't give me a seat on an earlier flight w/ availability. Shameful"
Your agent sent our family on 3 diff planes to dfw that were as Late Flight due to delay as the Cancelled Flighted plane that started this #fail
@USAirways charging $200 2 change a flight is a rip off the reason I have 2 is out of my hands &amp; I want 2 reschedule same flight but in July
@USAirways ANSWER THE BLOODY PHONE!
@USAirways I'm glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available.
"@usairways when trying to check-in online, it says to call...now I've been on hold for 2 hours...what to do?"
@USAirways #Unbelievable that for 2 consecutive days I can't get through to a person.  On hold over 2 hours and still going
employees are racist!!!!!
@USAirways stuck in Charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff.
my flight tomorrow is Cancelled Flighted you guys just keep letting me down
"I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing."
more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
@USAirways 4420 delayed further?
@USAirways should take a lesson from and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
crazy how every airline flew out to the northeast tonight except you
@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
"wanting a ⭐️ for the ✈️ finding the gate. No apology or exp. All good, I'm sure connecting flight leaving SAC will be chill!"
"@USAirways A tweeted apology is not enough for delay fiasco. NONE for insult from gate agent is worse. Except for Mark N., all bad at CLT."
now we are delayed until 1:02! This is ridiculous
don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y’all hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
@USAirways big problem!!! Fll to clt then got off on clt but my fly to gso is Cancelled Flightled had to rent a car to get to my pops funeral
@USAirways reservations had me on hold for 2 hours only to hang up...smh 😕
That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
offering us absolutely nothing for our troubles either. Blames the @TSA
how do you log out of wifi in flight? Don't see any option and made typo when logging in. HELP!!
I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
"@USAirways worst experience with you. Cancelled Flightled flight, no voucher and no luggage because ""ramp was broken."" No other ramps in Charlotte??"

"@danahajek : she means to say there has been so many complaints today (this week, this month) that she can't respond b/c she's alone"
@USAirways I've been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful
"@USAirways check in at St. Louis is so rude, even the TSA is nicer than them."
"3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story"
no you're not you're trying to book me PAST when i need 2 arrive but you're still selling seats on the day I'm trying 2 travel
"well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
it's freezing on the gate bridge#waitingforbags#united#EWR
Yeah that didn't happen!
@USAirways Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!!
@USAirways .... I've been trying to get through to book a reservation and the system will not let me through. Day 3 #ridiculous

Can care less if youre without your bags for a day or a week! Ive been 3 stories in the last 3 hours...I WANT MY BAG!
"it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
@USAirways I have a flight voucher/confirmation code but there is no where for me to enter it on your checkout page while Flight Booking Problems. Pls help
@tcunningham10 please call us back to rebook. 7403607771 we can't through!!!!! We need to get to columbus!!!!
My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
+ that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
"no, we still have not heard anything from anyone at or the @ErieAirport"
".Ah grasshopper, your twitterz kung fu no good.  Hire geeks. http://t.co/8MWItRi9kF"

sadly didn't get much help ... As a travel agent this is so disappointing to me.
@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
"love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
@united. epic fail. @reagan. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac!
that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. 😒
flight just Cancelled Flightled. This is ridiculous
why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
shut up an turn on the tvs/music
@USAirways and apologies are thin when you don't even offer hotel vouchers to your stranded customers.

@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
"@USAirways delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077"
this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.
@nathankillam or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around.
"Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that."
@USAirways you can't control the weather but you can control customer service. Without luggage for 24 hours &amp; still yet to speak to a human.
me again! I was just trying to rebook fare on wanna get away pricing and it disappeared in time I refreshed. Is this normal?
will you review your systems re notification? The website and telephone systems you have in place are clearly inadequate.
@USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
"Your wifi stinks. I'm not mad, but i wouldn't hate it if i got my money refunded."
understand waiting 2+ hours for callback on the exec plat line but when call dropped the agent could at least try again
me up in a hotel tonight and expect me to now pay even more money. I don't have that money!! I was supposed to get a call back
@USAirways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself
@USAirways needs to get it together in Indy. Only 2 ticket agents and a line to the door. Felt bad for ppl who missed their flights.
"Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home
"I tried, EXTREMELY RUDE. Even the supervisor. And when I asked to speak to HIS supervisor I was told no"
- my son left his tablet on plane.  Am out of country and can not call easily.  Is there an email to contact?
my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
I can't get an operator after an hour's worth of calls to Cancelled Flight a delayed flight. Automated system doesn't go beyond message.

"Just in case you needed confirmation that ""on fleek"" is dead &amp; gone. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/G4O6yX7TMJ"
".Alright prove it: (1/3) 3 days ago, I sat on a plane at JFK for 3 hrs, deplaned for 3 more, and when I re-boarded..."
also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.
I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees

@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/Ur60Un86gy
maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.
unable to access the website.  Will try again.
doesn't help if I have to fly on specific days
your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
your customer service today was deplorable.  There were plenty of ways u could have gotten us on that flight. #badcustomerservice
@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
Total BS.have 1st class seats for connecting flight. Your crew Late Flight. We miss connection. Had next plane. Yet u don't honor it??
@USAirways the exhaustion of traveling n runnin thru the airport and tryin 2rent a car n not killin myself my family or anybody on the road

"this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I'm open to what will u do to make the ""flight more pleasant."" http://t.co/VrQDpqEPFW"
@USAirways waiting for you to figure it out. This is unacceptable.
 my flight (6000) scheduled for 1pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate. Any update on how long of a delay?
@USAirways  in don't have it on me at the time as I am taking Amtrak home. How do we call for partial refunds?
"my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee."
"Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but ""unavailable""to book. False advertising much?"
no flights out of #nashville today? Are you kidding me?!?! Why are other airlines flying and you're not?! So frustrated!!
"@USAirways we've been waiting at the gate for 2 hrs, why are we now waiting to stow the luggage?"
bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
"my itinerary was from EWR TO DALLAS to LA. You Cancelled Flightled my flight, you have my money, find a way to get me there from EWR"

A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
@USAirways your customer service is horrible
@americanair flight veers off icy runway at @dfwairport. Most DFW flights Cancelled Flighted Mon http://t.co/Q37pOWn6uv @Cowboycerrone figures right?
once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
"Yes, myself and about 200 other people also."
"I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault."
" lost my luggage 4 days ago on flight VX 112 from LAX to IAD &amp; I'm calling every day, no response.Please give me back my stuff"
@USAirways I'm unable to check in for flight 2119 BOS-DCA and haven't heard if flight was Cancelled Flighted/rescheduled. Any updates??
@USAirways will these prices be honored? Ive waited this 1 1/2 hours on hold to make sure I can still get the prices I originally started
"@USAirways ""but I take meds that make me severely dehydrated"" {sigh}"
is your check-in system down? I'm having trouble checking in for a flight that departs in less than 24 hrs.
@USAirways understood. It simply feels as if the staff is not being entirely truthful about the situation.
I tried that &amp; they have been disrespectful not professional &amp; my 2nd flight been Cancelled Flighted I have to get home for a surgeryHELP
 Boo for a not refunding a seat upgrade fee I did not want to buy in the first place!
"Retrain in Customer Service first, make proper adjustments when Cancelled Flightling flights. Own up to your Mistakes."
"I have been trying to speak with an agent the whole day about my Cancelled Flightled flight, what I can do?"
@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
"THAT'S the tweet u choose to answer, to tell me you're not liable?! #youretheworst #neveragain"
this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
"@USAirways it is the same passenger, just her maiden name ended up as last name through online Flight Booking Problems.  Yes, understand non transferable"
"rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
"I am, called Paris office this morning again, still waiting. It is in Miami but apparently tag was ""taken off"""
too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.
"@USAirways booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service"
do you have the phone number of a supervisor i can speak to regarding my travels today
offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn’t exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
25 year customer but I am 6 3 and those lost 2 or 3 inches really hurt  every time the person in front shifts he raps my knees
now 1558 from IAH to EWR has broken entertainment system and no WiFi despite info on app: http://t.co/FY6f9rZB9k
 Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1)
@usairways Seriously. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to wait a hour for my luggage after I land. #wtf
on top of that my online record was unavailable as well and then couldn't get anyone on the phone.
".No. I watched these bags be abandoned at depart gate. Watched for &gt;40 mins until owner returned, 20+ mins after I reported"
"having trouble Flight Booking Problems a seat on US84 11 March, operated by AA. Neither airline's website will allow seat selection?"
I don't want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI :(((
I'm a huge fan and give y'all too much business...so please fix the damn wifi!
we're doing our best; sitting at a gate waiting (while not being given information why we're delayed) isn't making this easy
"your ""Airserv"" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity."
I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
132 characters does not cover my reasons I'm afraid
thx but I'll be expecting a credit for this leg.
"I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change"
I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
@ LAX is almost a mess. For some reason the express bag drop is slower than the full service line. http://t.co/ORY89eEGek
@emeyerson @ggreenwald Don't wait on a bag. Go to Walmart and get what you need for tomorrow morning.
Are there issues with the mobile boarding passes? My app keeps crashing when I try accessing. Thanks!
on flight 2416 to Orlando...ridiculous that we had to wait for this high school band to board. #notbabysitters #whrsthecoach?
"I would like to communicate directly with a ""Customer Experience"" executive. Does Joanna Geraghty have an email address?"
there's is nothing there because apparently I have to connect them for that to be true.
 at Logan airport and waiting to checkin for my 9am flight. Checkin desk not open !!!!! Why?!
I did not report the updated info - don't know how to reach them without a super long wait on hold at your main number.
step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don't suck so much
"that's the one. My original arrival time was 10:14am, after all said and done I may be there by 9:19pm central. Not impressed."
"yes, I've been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me."
@USAirways Only the JFK baggage office is open to help re-book all of us on Cancelled Flightled flight 3121 to DCA. Shameful.
@AndrewFallis same here! On hold for an hour &amp; then told @USAirways has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight
@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
please fix your mobile and desktop site to allow Canadians to select a passenger when checking in. Thanks.
@USAirways truly dissapointed when our flight is delayed and going to miss connection that we are expected to rebook our own flight????????
@USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.
@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
your app repeatedly crashed and failed to display my name when checking in. Was unable to use app. http://t.co/0kN7PjelZL
flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
@USAirways it's not like I'm trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don't want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU.
"not as sorry as I was when I sat on a plane for 3 hours waiting for the engine to be fixed and THEN got my luggage lost, but k"
"4285. Apparently we’re told, staff on the ground keep promising to come and they don’t."
Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats
that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
What's up with the wait times on your customer service line? Tried 2X on Fri. and now I've been on for over 15 min.
"@USAirways Yep, except this delay was due to a hasty and unwise decision to pushback other plane before the plows were done. #fail."
unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2)
 Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer!
considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane
ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home
Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
"yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU"
"@USAirways Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL"
yeah bruh its bool y'all niggaz just need to hire some more workers or something cause next time imma be forced ta disrespect.
"All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse &amp; buggy. So what's a little delay right."
it keeps saying that mobile boarding passes are unavailable despite having checked in and everything
@USAirways still waiting on your reps to show. Now 40 mins into waiting in below freezing weather waiting for a cab.
what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
Trying to make an online Flight Booking Problems one way from Barbados -NYC but wont let me as says I need a Barbados CC...why??!

at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
 3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. Also no origami in the magazine. New policies? #OldPoliciesWayBetter

@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
@USAirways Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up.  Recommend a call back feature.
Trying to add my dog on the flight but can't get through.
I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
your WiFi is shit. fix that up before I jump out of the closest bloody fucking emergency exit.
Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
she did. she's still waiting on a callback....the lack of follow through is what's concerning. smh
I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
why did you drop my call. Why don't you have more people answering phones? Why is it always high call volume when I call
@USAirways No US Air ppl anywhere in PHL directed stranded pax. Kudos to the PHL employees getting off work at midnight. Only help we got.
- thanks for Cancelled Flighting our flight to BOS. We're stranded in DEN til Wed night. The 7 of us will never fly #southwest again
hey! Tried calling customer service and was told there's a 2 hour wait. This has been for the past 4 hours. Thanks! You suck!
is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies
" you are over 40, please start acting your age and stop with the short-shorts!"
on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
your wifi is angering me with its slowness
@USAirways how does it feel to have almost everyone hate you?
"Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. http://t.co/Mb3bJwGOAp"
@USAirways Just to follow up here is my experience: http://t.co/WJIiGZtiwg
"That doesn’t make any sense. I’ve been 1K for over 5 years, and you’re making it harder to keep me loyal."
instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
"- We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight."
"Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger"
 requested window seat and confirmed window but got stuck in middle seat. Not a good way to treat silver member😒
- Hi Janet in customer service. I'm calling you back and have been sitting in que for 40 mins! Plz pick it up!!! #frustrated
@USAirways 3hr30min right now...  any end in sight?
@USAirways not best pleased with service so far. On our third gate and still no guarantee that it's the correct one :(
"oh, ok!  all good!  looking forward to escaping the cold for a bit!  thanks!"
@USAirways Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn't been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst
  Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a
I did but it only shows one flight one way. When I try to go to the home page and book roundtrip there's nothing available :(
@USAirways Credit to my bank account for the two days of work that I've missed because of these Cancelled Flightlations.
waiting over a half hour for my checked baggage to be delivered! No updates from any ground crew
@USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.
"res chg online/app no work, still on hold, faster for hubby to DRIVE to airport to make change @ counter #fail"
"oh I did. All I received back was an email saying "" delays happen"".. Uh huh.."
I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
"@USAirways my friends at KPHL were told by your rep ""if it were me I woulda just gone home this am and tried again tomorrow."" 1/2"
"Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing"
I hope so. Wanted an early flight to avoid the airport chaos but it's too Late Flight for that!
"You are jumping the gun and Cancelled Flighting flights that could've made it before the snow. Now, more Cancelled Flightlations. It's ridiculous."
"My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times
@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
"You are jumping the gun and Cancelled Flighting flights that could've made it before the snow. Now, more Cancelled Flightlations. It's ridiculous."
@USAirways pilot for flight 729 didn't show until after departure ⌚️ &amp; now there's a broken computer. Next time flying @United. #ALWAYSLate Flight
"well, your new baggage fees, fare structures and reduced legroom has turned you into every other hated carrier in the US. Congrats"
they say they have no update. I don't work I don't get paid.  Jet blue has my money but no flight. Argh!
"i ordered it as i always do. But on a 9hour flight delayed for 4 hours, it was worse than ever before when you forgot my meal."
@USAirways that wasn’t my Q but thanks. Wondering why you’re the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uH6UwuOSC0
Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :)
it's the poor customer service that I have a problem with!!!!!
BRING MY FIANCÉ @meerikangas BACK TO ME!
oh flight was fine. my lost luggage? not so much. looks like I'll be at least a half day Late Flight to my conference in Santa Monica...
yes there's issues on the site as well unfortunately.
@USAirways Your staff members are looking at me like I have two heads. Check your own websites!!! http://t.co/8Hh0c63TIe
"is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space."
"@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!"
what crew? No one here is helping.
@USAirways How do I get through?
None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
"took forever for catering to get to my flight, now are very delayed. So ticked off right now."
"I've been trying to set up my phone interview for days, and hoping the position won't be filled because the link doesn't work. @USAirways"
". 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines"
who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.
agent did help me. My point: there's a problem &amp; I don't want it to mess up somebody else's plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls?
All I requested was a refund of my Reward Points that I used to purchase the flight and he refused.
@USAirways Missed flight. Rude CSR. No flight till Tuesday. No answer on twitter. Help me out with a RT @pattonoswalt you're my only hope.
I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
@USAirways still crickets from customer service.
"agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful"
that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
" I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using.
So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs.
due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first
@USAirways How do I merge my miles accounts? Your sites tell me my info don't match even though I can't find a difference.
Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks
my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
now there is no one to operate the ramp to let us out of the plane in IAH...wow..just wow
DM me and I can explain the whole story. I should have been on an earlier flight not US1937
hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
it says I can't because my flight is in progress.
"Understood. Integration takes time, but no excuse for poor customer service"

"in line at SFO. Customer service is rude, disorganized, and congested. Very dissapointing."
@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
is the situation at JFK this evening is going to get better or worse ? Do not Cancelled Flight a flight like yesterday after 8h delayed

@USAirways [Part 2 of 2] she tried calling cust serv and the system hung up and her. Twice. Are you having system issues? Please advise.
isn't this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job?

can you not? RT Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/413GiAL0yl

Got it worked out. Had to postpone my trip and pay extra though. :/ Not easy for a poor graduate student.
no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
my flight is Cancelled Flightled due to weather. What next ?
"flight delayed...again...every time. ""Maintenance issues"""
You don't care about keeping your customers safe or at least you didn't care about my sister

"thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis."
Logically you would think you check all that before you have people board. I could've drove home in the time I've been waiting
we have to stay in Chicago overnight and meet up with our bags there. I hope they stay put and don't get put on a flight.

"Why doesn't your ""Best Fare Finder"" work?"
I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.
I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler

@united. DAY to IAD and CVG to IAD both Cancelled Flightled by United but all other airlines operating. Friend stuck and now miss intl flight. Help?
you are doing a horrible job at JFK...you need to rethink how you put these routes together. Unprofessional
so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
no response to DM or email yet.  customer service?
@americanair just tried calling. got a high call volume at this moment message and then it said goodbye and hung up…
One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
"flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"

@malhoit at least you got a response from via Twitter. I went 0 for 2 yesterday.
6 hours to get backs back after being sat on a plane for 4 hours to have flight Cancelled Flightled with only one small drink
@USAirways NOW they're not even accepting calls AT ALL! Come on.
@USAirways it's unacceptable the way your agents at the gate treat paying customers!!!

"@USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from perhaps."
@USAirways my sister was supposed to leave at 10 am to go back to AL. She's only getting to NC now. Are you kidding me #NeverflyUSairways 👿
time to reevaluate my nyc carrier.
"@USAirways I've been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate."
@USAirways 45 minutes and moved two feet in BZE. 👎 http://t.co/AwGjkjIIac
why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn't make sense to me.
"I, along with other passengers repeatedly asked Southwest personnel what was taking so long, where was our luggage."
@usairways  my flight has been Cancelled Flightled. On hold for 2+ hrs to reschedule. Need help now.  Taking way too long http://t.co/NeHnsDCkTY

@USAirways 1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down!
why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
"Hey Jetblue, you stranded an entire plane that was supposed to go to JFK and we are getting restless.  Need better communication!"
yes I do. I will get you exact data. Your download is fine it's your upload bandwidth and ping that are the issue. Ping especially
doesn't even have gluten free peanuts. whyyy me??
@USAirways pilot tells me that all and US Airways flights across the country have stopped due to a computer system failure.
Only wish your ground operation was as expedient as your Twitter response team! Delay just got extended!
you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can't do it online #yourphonesystemsucks

"@USAirways it a change fee request from a month ago.  after one hour on phone with your team, I’m told 120 day backlog.  Awful."

"I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
"It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"

flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
Tried...considerable confusion...no announcement...no sign updates
how do I redeem a travel voucher for a flight if I can't reach a travel agent by phone? My hold expires in 24 hours
"@USAirways question is why flight took off at all, now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city"

you Cancelled Flightled my flight and now I am in the back of the queue and you want to charge me 200  for business class? Stay classy
"is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer"
How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.
"@USAirways help! Flight Cancelled Flighted, can't call because my phone doesn't work in Europe. Please help? Says I'm booked want to confirm."
I have been loyal to Southwest from the beginning but very unhappy about your devaluation.
@USAirways the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail
.3 days &amp; still not home. Not even off the ground. 3. Days. #PastMyPatienceExpirationDate

"Noooo don't do it, please don't do it 😩RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/lsxJI0oUvR”"
3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
"Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag."
@USAirways abandoned 40 Boston bound fliers...someone in management needs to #saveface and #showup
made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
3 hours to rebook but 8 hours l8r the same problem again. Arrive at gate stopped cause now infant is sitting in 4 yr old lap
says the person who hasn't been delayed for hours and now sitting on a runway with a wailing baby ;)
@USAirways my phone has been on hold since midght  fkn 7 hrs of hold ?? Unacceptable!!!!!!!!
just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
it is cool. Your customer told me they didn't care either. It is expected

"@USAirways That's 1h 10m waiting to get my bag, 1h40m of flight delays, plus the 2hrs of delay I had on the way out. Never flying you again."
couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
how can u not have gate ready or gate agent for going on hour two
I’m going to miss a hugely important meeting because of your constant delays #itscostingmeincome
frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....
thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
"no hold times, just disconnections.   There is no excuse for that"
Thanks for the response.Tough night for all involved. Our flight got Cancelled Flightled as we started taxiing down the runway.
checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
 Applied for Status Match on Feb 1. Got confirmation email same day. Still no news though. You guys have dropped ball Late Flightly 😥
" gate agent at EWR "" if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it's time to board, please step"". STEP UP??? Lol"
I just sent a screen shot of the incident report.
bad customer service  to NYC a few weeks ago. Thinking of moving on
I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
I am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! This is HELL!!
been waiting on hold for more than an hour
"flt1533 to Carta what is goin on?! 1st told plane coming from hangar, then gate change, now no one knows wat plane we're getting on"

"@USAirways &gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service."
@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
"fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me"
the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
I'm a minor and freaking out bc I might not make my connecting flight to Hawaii so yes I'm frustrated
thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won't be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning.
@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
officially on hold for 2 hours!

you keep returning my call and hanging up when I answer? Help reFlight Booking Problems a flight!
@USAirways now what? You Cancelled Flightled my flight again... Are you paying for my hotel?
how you gonna Cancelled Flight my flight but run flights at the exact same time? Cmon fam

well our plane just landed at the international terminal... so they announced the 10 pm new time.
just deplaned at O'Hare gate K13. Why don't you send a customer service rep to discuss my situation? God knows...
didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me?
you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
just lost my business   Enjoy your profits
@USAirways who do we voice our concerns to when we can't get home with our 8 month old after waiting to taxi to a gate for 3 hours?
no wheelchairs
@USAirways oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn't fix the problem
"on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
"@jetblue well, we're on our way now, but more than half my tv channels are just static. 😔"
@USAirways PLEASE HELP need our plane to wait to go to #ELMIRA on Tarmac over an hr baggage took 45 and still not here thru customs
I've never had anything bad to say until now. No love for faithful customers.
yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
"@USAirways flt 4439 is on the ground, but you don't have a gate for us at dca. Why is this happening?"
@USAirways We take Late Flight to a whole new level!
thanks I'll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to.

@USAirways if you are going to make me wait in the phone for a long time can you at least turn off the ads they are eating away at my soul
@USAirways what is wrong with you guys and your inability to get planes in and out of Philly on time. Our pilot gave us a answer that was bs
@USAirways missing my reservations due to a Cancelled Flightled flight. Make it right by giving me first class tomorrow. Make your customers happy.
- really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC
"Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!"

which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive
Finally I get the right response. United must check this issue. UA 1514 EWR to PUJ on Friday 02/20/15.

yall have me sleeping in the airport until 4pm tomorrow! thanks
my flight 1106 was Cancelled Flightled and I need to get back to Cleveland. What are my options?
@USAirways now on hold for 90 minutes
what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
how about #destinationdragon tix for tonite for the inconvenience since I am not there to play scavenger hunt?
@SentieriMelinda Any updates? It shouldn't take hours for assistance. I love @SouthwestAir
@jetblue fly 2301 delayed do to ice at JFK ... Can I switch to a Late Flightr flight for free
@USAirways color me confused but why would i need to call and do this. Update your procedures and policies. You can see who is connecting
How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
I was worried when my bag went SAN to DCA 24 hours before me. But our reunion was an organized  breeze! http://t.co/uOARyQ98PU

thanks for telling me my flight got Cancelled Flightled when it wasn't. Now I have a missing luggage because of you. Thanks fam!
@USAirways  to arrive the plane I'm sitting on needs to take off...wish someone would tell us what the holdup is
Suck
@USAirways so you strand my bag in Philly last Sat and strand me in Philly this Sat. thanks for the bullshit.
"Will it be this year, do you think?"
ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united?
@USAirways not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN
"yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it."
that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
@USAirways I'll sincerely regret Dividend miles! Good things coming to an end :(
what response? Is our flight out of Montrose Cancelled Flightled or not?
Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
@USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.
"but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?"
thank you Mr Parker for screwing over chairman preferred when we fly AA. No #firstclass option and treated like crap by staff
"yes, 3 times. I need some one to call me and help me change a flight. I can't do online. Thanks."
on hold for 30 mins placed on hold then hung up on 2nd time in 2 days Only looking for group rates. BOS-SJU 5-12 to 5-19 10 people
@USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?
*does = doesn't
problem is on laptop not phone
of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
you can do better than this. And you can do better for me and all the passengers. #flight108 jfk to pwm.
what are the chances you will be Cancelled Flighting all flights in and out of Nashville again?
@USAirways what a joke of a company today reminded me why I never book with you
Flight 953 NYC-Buenos Aires has been delay since yesterday at 10PM. Is going to take off at 3.30PM now? Give us answers!
JH: going to process my refund for wifi. its asking for a receipt #? I never received an email- you guys just whacked my credit card
 if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I'll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris...
please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
it's pretty stupid and I probably won't fly it again. Plus hearing nightmare stories of overbooked flights.
why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn't explain delay.
That’s a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesn’t understand e-mail 101.
Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
Suggestions: tell customers approximate wait times when they are on hold (50 min now...) and allow them to Cancelled Flight online!
been on hold for 20 mins to Cancelled Flight my reservation. Can you assist?
"add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i’ll come back."
"You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent"

on hold for over an hour twice?  Terrible.
"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"

We have been waiting for almost 3 hours trying to rebook flights. PLEASE help us get through to someone.

@LukeWyckoff: her name is Jane and she wanted was a call. 617-653-3040

WHERE IS MY RECEIPT! I upgraded return leg and 6 months Late Flightr still NO receipt! http://t.co/DAjWzhLVyu
that's cool - now what?
yep after two hours and thirty minutes
"flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight"
I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
I Cancelled Flighted my flight. I really don’t need this much trouble.
good thing we noticed because she had re-routed 7 total passengers on an impossible triple connection as well
And yet we still haven't left yet and I can't watch my pre-paid DirectTV. #firstworldproblems
so am I going to be homeless or do I have a place to stay tonight? Can you respond to me here so I can go back to sleep?
I guess you weren't able to do anything to improve the time.. and now it looks even Late Flightr.. going to be a #zombie tomorrow
I guess I have to redo the Flight Booking Problems. Ugh!
@USAirways yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing
"worst customer service, Terrible attitudes. I don't care how big a storm.  Your employees need an attitude adjustment"
@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
"You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives?"
WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
"On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence."
are you a bot? Haha always same lies from you!
"&amp; if that wasn't enough, your staff have been so rude &amp; ignored passengers,don't think that should be accepted whatever reason"
Flight #2390 delayed 14 hours!! No one at #AmericanAirlines counter can tell my husband that he will be on that flight! Help???
"would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?"
also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
"Finally got a call from AA, but it was an automated voice that hung up on me! I called back &amp; it says it'll be 2 more hours."

If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.

"- well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!"
can I get any kind of update on the delayed flight from Boston to Houston at 7:30? Really need to be back home tonight!
 hi! i'm so excited about your $99 LGA-&gt;DAL deal- but i've been trying 2 book since last week &amp; the page never loads. thx!
so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
.@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.
@USAirways pretty upset I drove from Philly to MHtT still no info on my bags. What's the deal!
"No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again."
Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I'm not missing one. It was added to my bag ....
we have been sitting on the plane for over an hour. unacceptable. you have a complete disregard for customer service.
Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
@USAirways luggage and contents destroyed both on outbound trip last week&amp;inbound lastnight in philadelphia #Careless
why wouldn't you just credit it right to my account instead of having a separate sign on. That seems pretty ridiculous.
"waited in the airport for two days to get home, not weather reLate Flightd. Dealt with horrible customer service. Finally switched to"
@USAirways my bag is still lost and I can not get anyone on the phone to assist me and the tracking updates have stopped
@USAirways when I call it says y'all are too busy and to call back Late Flightr.  this is terrible customer service.  what will you do about it?
just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
I'm just calling to Cancelled Flight a flight. I already rebooked it on another card. Just need to Cancelled Flight the previous reservation.
a phone call or email when you Cancelled Flight a flight would be lovely.
"This must be a drone “@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
@USAirways Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can't sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed.
delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
on brd now.frustrated we go 2 #BUF not #ROC.if tld flt was gng 2b held earlier would not be a mess.cng bk unable due to overbk
currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
please get it together and find my husbands luggage! You're ruining his ski trip to Aspen! 3rd day no luggage.
would be great if I atleast was next to my husband who is flying in the same reservation
@USAirways u guys get too much $$$ and too many customers  to be fucking up as badly as u do
"bos to msp, msp to aus, aus to bos. Site doesn't seem to display fields for the middle trip when I add the 3rd."
"@USAirways still Effin waiting... Not weather delays, not engine trouble, but lack of crew?  Are you shitting me?"
"Oh,i already have turned  itover to them, but apparently losing someones bag on their honeymoon doesn't require accountability"
@ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
"@USAirways @Sb5551 Um, WE knew this storm was coming, ? Is why didn't USeless Air?  Staff accordingly u idiots!"
"#unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know"
@USAirways Uh yeah. Flight boarded &amp; now 1 hr Late Flightr we still sit. Update on 4435 to DCA?
"@USAirways disappointed with your toll free number. Terrible customer service, my flight has been Cancelled Flightled would like to get home"
@USAirways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?!
@USAirways You guys are screwing up my trip. Thanks for nothing. #lazy
@USAirways a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its
Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you've
@ShannonBloom Where's my DM? Where's my voucher? Who's paying my $70 cab and my $50 car back to JFK tomorrow?
@USAirways Flight 830 CLT to Phl. I was 1st on list.Someone else got spot. Rude employee in coach. Wouldt give ID. Said he was cute red head
@USAirways 3 delays 2 Cancelled Flightlations a double layover and 72 hours Late Flightr....could I at least get extra dividend miles?
AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
you have let me down! #oversold #earlybirdmeansnothing
probs the worst customer service ever. Replied to complaint I submitted 6 weeks ago bout damaged bag... Not even replacing it!
"also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB"
tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
"@USAirways @ClaudOakeshott don't need this link, after getting a person u now say u don't know where bags are. Lost on a nonstop phx to jfk."
"as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo"
I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I'm waiting at customer service.
@USAirways @Truthh4 they didn't give you the wifi password? Smh
@USAirways I don't need to rebook I need to know the policy
RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/NfjAuW16vZ&lt;--....😕
how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
@USAirways lol thanks to you we had to switch to American http://t.co/Sl6BDRXfN8
glad u happy I have my bag but as a traveler I entrusted u w/ my property &amp; u return it damaged &amp; that's the best answer u have?
@USAirways Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel &amp; I've submitted twice online
Bos-SF was in between waivers. Business Cancelled Flighted due to weather before/after. No flexibility/compassion in extreme circumstances = 😔
is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
not one of my four flights this trip has been on time. What the he'll is your companies problem?
are flights leaving Dallas right now? In Maui trying to figure out how delayed flight 7 is going to be
so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
I'm home &amp; only 9hr Late Flight.  No thanks to your service centre - their plan involved 4 flight legs all across NA and 2 full days..
had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd. No FF miles show up in my account for that :(
"@USAirways My wife, sick 3yr-old-twins, and I have been waiting in line now for 2hrs to see an agent! Phone agent said nothing til Tuesday!"
your customer service is crap.
".nice 2 know. I paid 4 a seat. Then you sold my seat. now I bought a 3rd seat. It's a good scam, but a scam all the same."
Cancelled Flightled my flight won't refund me and told me 2 call customer service n been holding for 30 minutes still waitin #BadService
@USAirways Has To Be THE WORST Airline Of All Time😡😡😡
@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...
.@Kaha58 Would be nice if you could actually talk to the reserv. team...it just hangs up on you and has been since last night.
@USAirways never flying you guys again. your customer service is awful
You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
"@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles"
"@USAirways  you were always my go to. What happened?  Airbus over Boeing, and now no customer service?"
why don't you take care of @Cowboycerrone flight screw ups
you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.
"That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?"
and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven't been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams
Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
Get a new crystal ball. Cancelled Flight flights before weather hits to rebook me on flight during? Looking like 2 nights hotel on me.
@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
@americanair Help!  I need to speak to a live agent before I lose my online reservation being held.
No I have not.
why a different airport! I have no way of getting to a different airport.
"@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing"
@USAirways gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans.
any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
"@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed."
@Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
"That's called throwing ""loyalty"" out the window and trying to give less awards."
@southwestair this inflight WIFI is the absolute worst. I'd be willing to have paid double for dialup speeds...  #Flight7
No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything's gr8
I've been calling your 1800 # all morning to change my name for an upcoming trip but am not able to get through. Please advise!
why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
any solutions?
My husband is responding to him and he insist to remove him from the seat. BTW signs are in both English and Spanish.
hey flight 5350 in dfw stuck at gate with no gate agent.  Plane full of people missing connections.
@USAirways i have been trying ALL WEEK to book a multi city award trip (can't book online) I'm told to call back some other time. What?!?
 on VX399 from JFK to LA - dirty plane - not up to your standards.
But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
I've been on hold for the last 2 hours - no progress #pleasehelp #stranded #whenitsnowsitpours #tgcyaLate Flightr
 they were empty upon takeoff. Why can't someone sit there?
@USAirways why have me board a plane knowing there is a maint issue?  US5235.
I hope you lose the next govt contract
 your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? http://t.co/hy0VrfhjHt
Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated
You've now put me on a BA flight - can I get access for 2 for the lounge? Been at ORD for 11.5 hrs now and still have 5 to go.
thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
would have been good to know months ago that you Cancelled Flightled our flights leaving tomorrow #telleveryone #jetblue #NeverAgain
"rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement."
why would they make me share a room?
please provide me your direct email for me to explain.
"@USAirways / was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time"
if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
Am I flying on Spirit air?
"Customer relations line had busy signal too, called the normal line and the service rep thought I was dumb for not knowing."
well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
"that 2 hr wait became a 4 hr one. And y'all claimed to have sent an email. Yeah, that never happened. #FlyDelta"
you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
" And now the flight Flight Booking Problems site is totally down. Folks, what is the problem?"
"our ft 1261 TUS/DFW (w/cx to LGA) tomorrow Cancelled Flighted,  4 hrs so far waiting for call back. What should we do? Need to get to nyc"

"flight1407, it's been a long day! Arrived from London at 11 this morning"
45mins wait on the phone with no option for a callback? Finally had to hang up because my phone was dying. #customerservice
@USAirways my vacation budget was blown bc of the lack of communication from USAirways. I will never use them again or refer anyone!
passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
"oh no, I'm rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation."
@USAirways now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck!
@USAirways still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory
how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever!
.@USAirways we have no choice but to pay another $50 to go to the airport in the hopes that we will be treated better by a rep.
@USAirways getting extremely frustrated w/ the phone/online service for merging frequent flyer miles.
Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW?

"The website won't let me view my reservation due to ""changes made outside http://t.co/nwF2FkA8fY"". I'm on hold now to get help."
"we tried. They're not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least."
My ticket was booked with AA with miles..... Sorry we sold you a ticket with a company we merged with but we can't fix it?
"aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10,000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers"

Thank u! Did reach out to both and have not had a response yet. Lost and Found goes straight to VM.

"your customer service is terrible, you're terrible, thought you should know."
"@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening ""in front"" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing"
@USAirways flight 1808 is not leaving at 2:45 because we haven't even begun to board yet. Please update your website ASAP
so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K
I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
@USAirways how do you do that? You guys need to have much better communication. How? How can we do that?
"lost 3 pieces of our bags, haven't delivered them in 36 hours, lied that they were delivered, and still no refund.  Never again"
something they're not telling us (2)
my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight

I'll try to have a great week once I receive it 😩😭💔
Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.

delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United?
Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
Hi! Just got my TSA pre-check # &amp; put it in my acct. But it's not on my boarding pass for a flight this p.m.Can it be updated?
I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!!
flight 577  fll to sfo. No speed line even though I paid for it. No coffee on flight. and my non stop now has an unscheduled stop
@USAirways i've been on hold for an hour trying to change my flight!!! COME ON
please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.
"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
"I may not make my connection and need to find out my options, yet no one is here."
would someone please DM me the customer relations number. The website has only customer service.
"You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 ""goodwill credit"" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it."
@USAirways Still waiting for another crew member. #cabinfever
I would like to be reimbursed for my shuttle from Denver after #1080 diversion 6+ hours sitting in plane and mech problems
"Its the ABC's of PR, let your customers have the most info possible. Might want to go brush up on the basics..."
@USAirways cardholder is flying.  We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating.
having to pay for a hotel room in Cleveland because of last minute Cancelled Flightled connecting flight. Booked through united..Unimpressed!
@USAirways Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!
is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
@USAirways told to work it out ourselves #joke #fail
@USAirways This is the worst flying experience of my life. Flight scheduled for departure at 5:44pm from Phl. 5+ hrs Late Flightr guess where I am?
and YOUR costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. It's scheduled for 455
How do I stop getting credit card apps? I already have a card!
thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
ANOTHER F*CKING DELAY IN THE PAST 32 HOURS!?
my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight?
@USAirways thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer.
on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I'd be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation.
 luggage was severely dented/missing wheel coming off baggage claim in SAN. Luggage agent Miranda (I think) wasn't any help.
"@SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice"
  What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
"when I called I was told my bag had made it to PHL, but still has not been delivered or any call from the delivery service"
"'s computer systems are down, can't leave without a flight plan! Any ETA, American air?"
@USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
"Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"

it's not just frustrating--it was PAID for! how do we get a refund?
Couldn't use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them?
"have a flight from Oakland to SNA at 7:30, and I asked if I can take 5:30, even there are 5 empty sests. Answer is ""No"". :("
every time I search a flight your site logs me out and gives error message. About to book on a different airline and Cancelled Flight my card.
"I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept."
“@USAirways: @ch_mom Please reach out to our crewmember for assistance. Our apologies for the long wait.” #generic
@USAirways Your customer service line keeps telling me call back Late Flightr and disconnects. How can I talk to someone about my flight?
"flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice"
"it seems I never received an ID, just a password."
 I was really looking forward to my flight. can you let me know when it will be rescheduled? #diehardvirgin
@dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that's he's going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He's a hoot!
I've been on hold for 2 hours!  When will you answer??
how on earth could you close the united club in Atlanta? What a major #fail at an airport of this size
flight attendant doesn’t understand not understanding English doesn’t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
They inquire and then do nothing about it...pretend they’re interested. Responded to your DM and no response back...
"@MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time"
now this http://t.co/uygeW2Nosr
my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days!
been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
my travel for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled and then stupidly rebooked for tomorrow! I can't get through to reservations!
@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp; family this is crazy
"playing hide and seek with the gate. ""We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes."""
@USAirways @PHLAirport how can a plane scheduled to come in on time and actually happen. Then you bozos don't have any room us. #incompetent
I have to miss a whole days worth of work tomorrow but I'm suree you guys don't care
do these scavenger hunt  locations have anything in common because I'm playing detective trying to figure out the one for ATL.
is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
still waiting. Just hit one hour.
"thanks a lot for sending a ""special deal"" with @Budget. Getting screwed is the best when on vacation #sarcasm get new partners"
I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!
 I like the TV and interesting video . Just disappointed in Cancelled Flightled flight when other flights went out to jfk on Saturday .
and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
"Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?"
I am heading to JFK now just on principle alone to deal w my lost &amp; damaged bag. #jetblue #jetbluesucks #jfk #badservice #fail
could I get a phone call from a customer service rep to get the issue resolved?
"broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs"
I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
Why would you charge money to transfer points to someone?
received a voucher but if you want to improve relations be up front with passengers.
no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.
@USAirways worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you.
@USAirways great job communicating to the passengers! Flight 1855 doesn't exist anymore? http://t.co/hLZaHXkdSn
then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
"really American Airlines , service is Las Vegas is shocking, absolute jokers take your reputation more seriously!"
flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
someone is here but has no info smh one bag came off  and then nothing
probably wouldn't be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993
feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
"@americanair flight veers off icy runway at @dfwairport. Most DFW flights Cancelled Flighted Monday, Flightaware says. http://t.co/atwyiFh6Zy"
You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!
"I had it until last night, but because ""severe weather"" I could make the needed changes and now fair goes up 150 each."
when will airfare be available through December of this year? I have 2 major trips coming up and I'm anxious to book them!
I left my apt 10hrs ago to go from Boston to SJC and I'm still NYC. Please bring back the nonstop flight. #jetblueBlues
is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM.
@USAirways The fact we did not get notified hindered our ability to look for alternate flights before they were snapped up.
@USAirways thanks for making me check my bag when the space was empty and to the flight attendant for the dirty look http://t.co/9rx5HOmM25
"thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn't cleaned properly"
When will callers from the East Coast be able to speak to an actual human for reservation support? All agents busy call Late Flightr..
"thanks for the call on my Cancelled Flightled flight, NOT!  Flight Booking Problems me for Tues no good weather caused me 2 leave early"
gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
@USAirways a flight update doesn't help when we are waiting 20+ min at our arrival waiting for a plane to leave our gate. Who can I write?😑
AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
@USAirways horrible experience to key west lost luggage called to check &amp; was told not to call back reconsidering my flight back
1hr 46 min. Cost of flight change $788. Was $188 2hrs ago b/f drop call. Cancelled Flighted flight. Asked 4 refund.
I waited in line all that time to be told by a crewmember that there's no update until 9:30 #3HrDelay #disappointed
"next time my flight's Cancelled Flightled, I'd appreciate SOME indication (email, text, carrier pigeon). App didn't even warn at check in"
"doesn't care about customers, break your gear and tell u they can't do anything. @WSJ @latimes @chicagotribune #media #filmcrew"
@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
Also Agent not aware clearly of http://t.co/FWKJ49B1LE
I have received one previously on the 11th having checked. Odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail?
" UA 1706 there is no way a plane ""loses its software"" I believe you decided to do an upgrade..."
what's the delay if the system isn't down?
"@USAirways First the pilot was Late Flight, now it's maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable."
FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
"“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Lv9HwQDK9A

Oops...no functioning bathrooms on a fairly full flight?  Hope everyone on 702 from New York can hold it.  Me included.
my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!!
Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying.
#albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
Oh yea? That's it? C'mon buddy! Bring your special friend to the conversation - they seem to be doing NOTHING AT ALL
"@USAirways  flight missed due to mech issue. No food voucher, transported to different airport, no rental reimbursement 😡"
yes. We spent the whole day talking to agents and someone finally offered to let him stay in a hotel
I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
no but seriously wtf? #nochill http://t.co/esd3XD5V1r
I let a crew member know every time this happens.  Which is most of the time.
@USAirways is holding my luggage hostage from flight 5182
@USAirways @nburnside26 Well if you really didn't like them then she would be on an airplane. #FIOUSAirways 💁
"Hold for 15 min, a couple of rings, then ""mailbox has not been set up yet."" Customer service forwarding to their cell phones? C'mon"
"used to exclusively fly SW, but Late Flightly, direct flights &amp; cheaper costs have me switched. 😔 why...so... few...direct...flights?"
@USAirways your mobile app is horrible!  Needs a major overhaul
"flt 136 from PHX. Delayed 2 hrs, circle 1 hr, divert to upstate NY, just sitting for 1 hr No communication #horrible"
can you have someone call me back? I have been on hold two times today for over 20 min and still haven't gotten through
We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
"So much for Status, EP and 1.5 million miles.  Revenue First class ticket and Im sitting in Coach thanks your rude CS staff"
I'm on flt 700 lax to FLL both ppl are sleeping so Id rather not disturb in flight. Tried to dl movie no go http://t.co/Nh2i9ZlzMk
"I've been on hold for an hour now. 59:57 as I type this. Ridiculous! All I need is the link to the chart that has routes, time"
I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.
we followed the baggage rules on your website and was still charges $150. But only going one way
"after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!"
yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.
"you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven"
I am going to be stuck in Florida for 3 days because @SpiritAirlines wouldn't hold my connecting flight to LGA
@USAirways so you're going to make me wait that long on the phone line when you can help me? # that's part of the problem
@USAirways we appreciate auto rescheduling our Cancelled Flightled flight-- but you have nothing sooner than Tuesday? can fly into alternate loc?
"Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!"
rep wouldn't rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication
"@USAirways why don't you hire people to deal with the call volume, this is absolute garbage #incompetent"
You didn't respond to my DM. You tweeted the same canned tweet you're telling everyone else.
@USAirways how is it possible that you don't have a call back service? An automated message telling us to call back Late Flightr is so unhelpful.
@USAirways holding 30+ min and listening to your shitty ads on repeat for your credit make me hate your airline even more.  @delta is better
thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail
@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
".after 50 minutes on hold, and another 30 minutes on the call yes. Going to be pushing it to get to the airport on time now"
it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn't a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
how can I when system always hangs up on me?
how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
@USAirways Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight
worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you're delayed
@USAirways Never mind that you could have told the gate I was on my way - you could delay 10 mins but not 15?
@USAirways agent won't hold for connection arriving Late Flight. 7 min before departure time but 3 min too Late Flight. Flt 1903 gate c19. Disappointed
"@USAirways No need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . There is no up date, I've landed but was suppose to land at 5"
@southwestair TWO hours on the plane at the gate?!? This is undignified behavior for you. And the apology isn’t enough. #freedrinkcoupons
and now no wifi??? Come on.
@USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it...
@USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back
you have failed so uncontrollably today that it's beyond repair. I'm beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.
"@USAirways #not happy, wife 40th Bday trip. would like to be fully compensated for both flights"
my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund?
"flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?"
"@USAirways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold?"
cost me over 200 dollars because flight was Cancelled Flightled and couldn't even give me a food comp!! Fly they take
now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse
Why won't you let me leave Newark!?
@southwestair Thanks. Yes I got through. Biggest frustration is that I'm no longer able to check in online for my flight after 4 Cancelled Flights.
"@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed."
"@USAirways now has stranded is in #Miami without updating any of the departure boards, and once they Cancelled Flightled the flight there was no..."
@USAirways the phone number the gate gave me doesn't work either. What is your customer service phone number?
"@USAirways should, but didn’t."
Blackmailed me into paying £130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
Ive had on an airline. Everyone else has been great but she soured the whole experience for me. Hope she's not there next time
we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing

@SouthwestAir: why no charging station in SAN?
site errored out at last step of changing award. Now can't even pull up reservation. 60 minute wait time.  Thanks @United!
" To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks."
Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system.
 you have now lost my luggage for40 hours holding for4 hrs on phone #wtf is this how you treat your loyal passengers?#stranded
"nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son http://t.co/0pRGySvuRm"
my Mistake multibillion dollar company
My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air!
@USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever.
and it's not a inconvenience it is a disaster. It's A $500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay
#2298. Everyone else  was outstanding.
reviewing your oversize policy. Hardcase golfbags are free if under weight. How do we add guitars and instruments to the list?
@USAirways have had a medical issue Late Flight yesterday and need to change my flight today been on hold for an hour and still not through
we've now lost a whole day of our honeymoon... Very disappointed and frustrated with everything.
@USAirways 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous!
"@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me."
Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home.
@USAirways 2 hours and 7 minutes. Just want to know I'm still in the queue...
no had to rebook my flight myself and am about to board in bham.
"@USAirways : When You've Got to Get There, We've Got Excuses! #usairwaysfail"
"my bag was lost, and according to the rep they don't even know where it is, Please help."
"@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?"
has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
@USAirways we have seats.  on phone Iwas  told I was getting error msg due to paid 1st class upgrd. told to check in after 12am.sound right?
- not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
@USAirways I was re accommodated for my DSM flight tonight after a delay from Myrtle Beach now the flight to DSM is back on for tonight?
"you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool."
"@vanessaannz seriously, you hate since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny"
Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM.
"@USAirways of course! ""Yeah, travel has gotten harder. Ask other passengers if they will switch"" it's not the fact, it's the attitude!"
"flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH"
I don't have enough hands to count the number of times something like this has delayed my flight with you guys. Very disappointed.
maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
. I don't understand why you need a DM to give me an answer on if you have a damaged luggage policy.
you told me you changed my flight and im in the ottawa airport and AC cant find my reservation! Whats wrong with you
My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online?
@dultch97 kid just wants fucking money #scumbag
"well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport"
yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
been trying to speak to agent for 24hrs about my Cancelled Flightled flight but reps always busy. how do I get ahold of you?
@USAirways nah it's for my flight next week.. inside my Chairman 7-day window but you still haven't released the last open First seat to me
Why offer automated call back option when agent is available only to call me &amp; have me sit on hold? At 12:30am. #onholdfordays

"@USAirways Your software is broken. ""Call Customer Support"" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers."
 your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage.

"@JetBlue, my dads vacation to SXM got delayed a day because of shoddy service. Earliest FLL &gt; SXM flight? trying to hep him out"
the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
"@USAirways. wow, awful customer service."
@USAirways worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail
"everyone deserves red carpet tx until they destroy your luggage &amp;only give you $75 voucher, like I want to fly w/them again!"
On hold for two hours and it timed-out on me. Great system you got there.
@USAirways thanks for crappy hotel with no food and a taxi bill followed by being on standby for your Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways
Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can't get through.
most terrible flight experience happening to everyone right now on Flight:UA1750 6 delays 4 hrs total missed all my flights now thnx
@USAirways I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help!
"Hypocrisy RT @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP"
@USAirways I called twice the recording says that it has being delivered to my apt but it is not here ?
but have been yet to receive assistance from one of your agents in securing a new connection. Many will now miss work tomorrow.
"Sure was,  with  looks like I'll make my birthday celebration after all."
once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD.
@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
@USAirways can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline #wth
=UNAmerican Airlines just lies and poor customer services...

"You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!"
apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
" Hi, Virgin! I'm on hold for 40-50 minutes -- are there any earlier flights from LA to NYC tonight; earlier than 11:50pm?"

"- watched the entire #UNCvsDUKE game on the Tarmac before Cancelled Flighting my flight because crew timed out, right before my 4hr flight...."

"@USAirways : i have been trying to reach dividend miles  to extend my ticket for last 3 days , 20 + calls and i get a message to call back"
 please provide status for flight 769.  I cant imagine it's on time as the Web indicates  dude to weather here and/or Dallas
Checking tracing information. You got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number &amp; how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag?
I've flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers.  You went from first to worst
"bag turned up, no thanks to your useless call-centre and useless website"
8 hours Late Flightr and I'm siting on another plane waiting to leave. I think a credit is in order for this terrible service!
"after waiting for a delayed plane, we sat on the plane for an hour waiting for a Late Flight passenger. That's BS too.."
@USAirways Decided to be a good sport and give you guys another shot. Flight delayed. Again.
"it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people"
"UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say ""oh well"""
"My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed."
I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
at 5 am and have no clue if we have a place to stay or not
over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
"That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this."
stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
"trying to change my reservation, been on hold for 45 minutes, and can't do it online-was directed to call. Help?"

@USAirways How many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls?
@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can't get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update??
"disappointed with customer service right now, my flight was only one Cancelled Flightled at my airport &amp; now I'm losing 2 days from trip"

plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
@usairways missed flight connection due to flight attendant delay. Yet no voucher on your part? #fail
@USAirways Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!!
@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
"@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!"
@USAirways  is there a better time to call? My flight is on Friday and I need to change it. Worried I may be on hold until then.
@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
maybe announce the delay so we don't sit on the plane on the runway for an hour+ before taking off
still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
"keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service"
"@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed."
"disappointed in the 'service' I've received. Checked in online, checked my my flight status online, CHECKED IN AT THE AIRPORT"
I've been in pricing for 8 years to know that 70 bucks a seat is criminal. 20-30 I understand. #pricing #flying #jetblue #pricewise
what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service!
@USAirways According to your costumer support your website is holding my money hostage and you cant do anything about it..
THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
had a maintenance issue. Stuck in Geneva with meal voucher that won't even cover a pLate Flight of spaghetti. Really.
 I did it but there was a problem in the link from the email for check-in. thanks
@USAirways on delayed flight from Phil to stt and looks like we'll miss the car ferry to at john where our lodging is. Help with housing?
Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
Bummer. Might have to go with card instead. TY for response though.
2 aisles of empty #evermoreroom seats and we can't move bc we didn't pay?! #nonsense #Waste #JetBlue #jetbluebos #cheap
@USAirways thanks. We did see an agent. Unhelpful. Some got vouchers others did not for unexplained reasons.
just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.
"@united, I don't believe that you do.. http://t.co/7z3GqEBfK2"
I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
don't know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love.
stuck in airplane both on way out of PHL and again in Houston. All passengers frustrated. Makes me want to avoid airline
has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer
"I guess that's not the busiest route, so based on traffic/fuel costs, regional jet is the decision, but still not great 4 travelers."
NOW you love me? After taking my money and only taking me halfway home. Sorry. Too Late Flight
@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat

"no one received text alerts, automated calls, anything either. Literally no information as to what was happening."
nah u boofin u dont talk like any humans i know. Respond like u actually have a brain. And again i dont want customer relations
you're giving everyone tix for #DestinationDragons except for me and it's during my birthday!!!!
won't let me send a DM because they don't follow me.. #lovedflyingwiththem #notanymore #wrong #badpolicy
@USAirways issues are not with people who r nice or storm emails with wrong phone numbers auto rebooked flights to non connecting cities
I just booked a flight with you guys. I'm reconsidering that decision now after reading this tweet.
@USAirways lost our luggage. #yay
how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
"when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not?"
why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149
the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating
or @flysaa has lost my baggage… heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
My Flight 1318 is delayed and I am connecting from Boston. Is it possible to switch me to Flight 118 so I can make my connection?
"@USAirways Batting 1.000! Four flights in a month, all four delayed!"
@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
seriously? After waiting 2 hours on the plane for my 10:20 flight to leave at 3pm I have to leave the plane? Great. Just great.
@lpalumbo what weather sun is out
I've been trying for 4 hours to get hold of someone.
Hoping you answer the phone today?
can we get an explanation on why UA978 from São Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta.
"@USAirways how is it that the airport (DCA) and the airline mess up our flights, but also will not cover our hotel costs? At DCA for 5hrs..."
@USAirways  sitting on Tarmac in #PIT for 30 min. No announcement. Just sitting.
thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
@USAirways 😂. Passed frustrated 4 hours ago after being asked to get off the first plane I sat on for an hour.
"Promotion also said two free round trip flights. Nope, had to pay $200 extra for chi to Vegas. Bait&amp;switch."
@nrosenb1 It's not allowing me to book available seats

can we get a honest update on departure of flite 454. Been on plane with infant children
same here. Would appreciate a follow so I can DM my info to figure out what I am supposed to do.
@USAirways @PeterPiatetsky Ummmm I think US Air's computers@were@down for hours - my flight is 3 hours Late Flight.
how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
You Cancelled Flight my flight and there’s no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc @Delta
@USAirways  but have to return car to clt can I skip my flgjt back tonight from gso to clt and pick up at clt to fll I was told yes
@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
yes I did but no response.
Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats.  Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d
well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
flight Cancelled Flighted! I'm trying to get to #chicago. What are me and @justynmoro gonna do. #flying#flight#travel
while I appreciate that you actually responded I travel way too much for you to tell me coffee is not a basic option
"Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of DFW today/tomorrow?"
very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies.
why is my 910 flight listed on time when its 904AM and I'm not on the plane yet? http://t.co/iEG2ObcEpp
"@USAirways this is ridiculous.  I have a 6:00 AM flight and two hours of rest, wasted!!!"
@USAirways you are cutting into my pregame time.  Go @KentuckyMBB !!!!
"you Cancelled Flightled my flight due to ""weather"" when others are flying out just fine.  No compensation, no resolution.  Incompetent."
"4hrs Late Flightr i get a call back, and immediately disconnected"
@USAirways This flight was for my brother. He has been rebooked and I was able to give my info over the phone to get him a pass to the Club.
@USAirways you guys suck at JFK tonight -- oh this MORNING!!!
thanks for making me miss an important dinner tonight. 2 hr delay and now 20 min on Tarmac... #worst
"rather than trying to resolve customer issues, only options offered were paying cash @ airport or write letter. #JustifyThisSupport"
my wife is stuck in #Brownsville any chance she can get any flight out? She needs to be at work tomorrow morning.
no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
She 👏 won't 👏 be 👏 at 👏 my 👏 wedding 👏. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There's no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this?
"This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?"
i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck
@USAirways why the hell will you not put us in a hotel when you've stranded us. Your message says mechanical issues not weather. #usairways
.Will breaking them in somehow make them longer so that they don't cut off the circulation in my legs? #unfriendlyskies
@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
@USAirways how do I get a hold of customer service? I've called multiple times &amp; have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up
"Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm."
can you help me with reFlight Booking Problems? My flight was Cancelled Flighted. FWHEI6
@southwestair Your staff was really kind about the flight delay. Luggage? Not at all. Very disappointing.
super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn’t 1997!
on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
"you realize you've said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed ""help"""
I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
"would have been had I seen this before 1130pm EST, when I was sound asleep."
what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
"update 35 minutes into this pilot has turned off a/c. No longer freezing, but we are enjoying waiting for reload of all bags"
"Wanted to get my bag benefit, but instead get $25 pricing on all three tickets. When adding a card, MP Visa is only option. @united"
A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I've had. What's up?
"there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures"
this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
it's poop and barely works
@USAirways still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please
"how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact?"
any idea what's going on at terminal five at JFK? Seems to be zero traffic movement
@USAirways help im falling out of one of your planes
"you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?"
jumped the gun a little Cancelled Flighting our flights? No other airline is Cancelled Flighting out of Louisville. You're ruining my vacation.
please see a flight attendant for what? Why isn't there enough room for over head bags? I carry on to save time!!!
lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place

"UA1130 Flight was a nightmare!! From poor customer service,having my confirmed seat given away.... +more issues"
should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight 😕
is seriously THE WORST. I don't remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn't delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc!
How am I supposed to Cancelled Flight it if I can't do it online?  I don't want to lose all the funds on the ticket.  HELP!!! :(
I've called that and they said they can't help me and it's out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer
how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
@cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
"@USAirways We did. said to open one with you, too."
me because it might not be so urgent for you but it really is for me. (5)
now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off
 why can't we book seats on your flights when we buy them or even during check in? Creates so much anxiety! #frustrated
@USAirways The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.
i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag.
"@USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again."
"@USAirways I've been on hold with your Divident Miles service desk for 45 minutes, and that's after being hung up on the first time."
Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction.
"doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk
should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
".Yes, total of 4 hours on hold. With all the Cancelled Flightlations, one would think there would be more staff. Decided to cx and drive"
"Social agencies, this is why we can't have nice things. @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/QRxz0bGbtq"

@USAirways There isn't a ticket number...the transaction is still pending.
My bag is lost and I can't get ahold of anyone that can help
"My reservation is on hold, not me.  Wish I was on hold but that's not possible with the phone issues at #americanair"
@USAirways I will NEVER fly us airways or american again and I will share this nightmare of a story to all the many others we know who fly
"@USAirways Suggestions , been on hold 2 hrs for flight that is now about to pass departure...Dealing w ny weather, need change"
no. Told to call cust service on monday
Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
"It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!"
thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
#UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
Just got companion pass and trying to add companion flgt but get purchase.error.INVALID_LOYALTY_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_STATUS. Help!
"your call center won't let me wait on hold, which I would happily do. Am I seriously supposed to just keep calling? Not great"
"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
we are the airline that has Cancelled Flightled flights TOMORROW to the NYC area
I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK
@SouthwestAir- I called and they solved the flight Cancelled Flightlation issue in 15minutes. May be ask them how to do it? #getmorehands
"she cut people off 35 minutes before flight time to check in bags, for a flight that was delayed 2 hours! I waited 8 more hrs!"
as usual my next flight shows on time but it's suppose to leave in 5 minutes and hasn't boarded
"To think that I'm a ""Priority Member""! Wonder how you treat the plebes. I know which rewards card I'm Cancelled Flightling immediately."
just want to thank you guys for the 27 hour delay for flight AA106 from JFK due to staff shortage and not weather✈️
@USAirways I've flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words.
1416 Cancelled Flightled? Can't get out for two days? No explanation?
it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents 👿
"It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
@USAirways I want to love you! 43 minutes on hold! Help me understand why I switched loyalty programs. http://t.co/cHGy5yrVka
@USAirways WORST customer service ever!!!
"Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless"
and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
I'm flying into DCA my bag is at IAD.  I am already Late Flight for my meetings at work.  I will call the number when I land 😭
not in any way that I am happy with or find acceptable.   If I could speak to a human maybe that would happen
"@USAirways 8 hour delay pho-mia, your airline is bad and getting worse, Foolish for american to merge.  You treat your customers like crap"
@FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. http://t.co/8VnCKgZxl1
"made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money &amp; aggravation!"
#611 from JFK to LAS still delayed?
"Yo, I'm trying to make a change to a reservation but whenever I select the flight it says, ""Unable to price"". Please help!"
especially during a death in the family and still no solution. 96 hours and counting...Thanks
 My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
it's beyond complicated now and it feels like when I used to fly with United. Platinum means nothing.
I don't want to waste any more of my time on your airline (you've already robbed 21 hours of my day) but I definitely will.
lost @LeslieWolfson luggage on flight yesterday morning #Miami to #NewYork #LGA no response and no luggage more than 37 hrs ltr

Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
has terrible customer service &amp; doesn't feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed
@usairways who is the next stop after customer service.
@el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
your call system is a fucking joke
@USAirways Sitting on the runway at phl for the last 30 min because the correct weights for the flight aren't in the system? #jobfail
@USAirways just be prepared for a claim if that bag is lost ... Too many valuables to carry in my hands. #us2146 to #aa2924
hi we have lost and found solution we want to offer for free to assist with contacting people when items are found
@USAirways it's painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! http://t.co/ocqk0JFXuA
"Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?"
@USAirways @BohnJai they lost my bag @PHL baggage handlers broke open my bag and stole my camera
landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
@JulGood1 she was traveling with me the one that got miscommunicated with
@CNN @nbsnewsr @cnnbrk except you aren't working with her youve done nothing to help
is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst
@USAirways - just passed the 3 hour mark #onholdwith you for THIS call.  Gave up after 2.5 this morning.

Y do U not reply to customer refund forms??????????? #unitedairlines
flight was two days ago. Flight 1918 from POS.
"Yes - with extra $77. I wonder what are you going yo loose, if there is room."
so technically I could drive to JFK now and put in. Request for tomorrow's flight?
"3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed."
"if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"

"your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?"
@USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
- are you aware your airbus fleet sucks?  I'd rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit.
- don't understand why I have zero Flt info- no email- 2 he wait time on ph lines- so much for Advan Mem :(
"Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min...."
don't worry. I'll be sending a letter with what I expect from you for compensation. I fly twice a week w/you guys...for now
We have been sitting on this bird #AA1457 for 2 hrs on the dfw tarmac.  Some water would be nice.  Where's your manners?
broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
@UnitedAirlines and the hits keep on coming. http://t.co/44ZHmfDIW6 #unitedfail #unitedwithivy
no I wasn't. After over an hour was too frustrated and had to hang up.
@USAirways 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can't even fix it. Worst service I've ever had
gate agents disappeared and customer service agents were miserable and unhelpful. #letdown #neveragain
@USAirways stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS
hello I am flying first class and am behind 20 people on zone 1!!!!!  Pls pass on to app dept - you should board 1st class first
My sister just received a call that her trip Wednesday (flts 2348/3499) was Cancelled Flightled and resched to next day. Why?
"Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct?"
how come I'm not getting my points after I buy from the rapid reward shopping site?
"@USAirways its fine.
@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.
@USAirways I was completely ripped of by US Airways today never fly this airline  I am contacting my local news
"Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited"
"@southwestair,  Your male flight attendants must being playing a game called Who can be the Bigger Dick to People. Flight 952 to CHI-MID"
I need updates on my flights 464 &amp; 3574. I have been on hold for over 2 hours.
Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better
how long does it take for points from RR Shopping to post to my account? Got email saying I've earned points but don't see em
"well, now I'll make sure to never fly JetBlue"
@USAirways. Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow.
where was the inclement weather? Other flights left DCA today and this plane appeared to be coming from AUS.
what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
@USAirways more like USDELAY-ways. Another long 'paperwork' reLate Flightd delay - Friday in Charlotte. Today in Philly. #letsgoalready
Flight Cancelled Flightled out of BNA.... Do I have to reschedule now or can travel funds be put back into my account for future use?
@USAirways I tried reaching out to you guys I'm running out time and patience I just want my flight to be honor and I want a confirmation!
any info on why flight 704 from SJU to JFK is already delayed 2 1/2 hours?
1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!!
@USAirways 2nd plane forced to get off due to mech and wait for 3rd need housing and meals in STT need help b4 we arrive at STT please
trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?
almost bumped me off my flight to HRL when I was 20 minutes early then your staff was rude when I asked what was the problem?
there was also not one single person at the counter answering questions for our plane full of confused people. No staff at all.
"Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience"
I will never choose @USAirways over you again! #getmeoffthisbird
over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
Well we won't be flying you. Rebooked on Jetblue. With credits (that actually work) it was free!
@USAirways hey let flight 1874get to the gate  hours Late Flight and no fate with dozens of kids on board
we need an ETA please
How many trees have to die before you stop trying to sell us a credit  card? #OptOut http://t.co/CXrZhcdTVz
I'm not booked on a 1:30 return flight..
I filled in the form on the website too. Darn it all. I guess I'll just have to cross my fingers.
right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
Okay... If someone does it look for it now my fear is it will be lost forever. It's a very small item.
@USAirways undermines the intelligence of customers by ignoring their complaints with their copy and paste canned responses #usairwaysfail
"Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times."
@USAirways it still says that I can't check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly
"Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You're welcome. #badservice"
@USAirways #Wronganswer. Talk is cheap. Customer service is the action of making things right for the customer. #fail again.
flight 348 is a freaking nightmare tonight #sittingonthetarmac #delay
all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I'm looking for something a little more specific.
how come I have no baggage updates.
funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool
@MrJustyn I heard companies were studying popular lingo for advertising but this is just depressing and embarrassing.
"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
I spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they can't help. Need help with family pooling asap.
"Is your company motto: ""I do not care!!!""  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.""  #idonotcare"
I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
my request has nothing to do with rescheduling. But customer service has such a bad attitude today. #badservice
...2/2 doesn't help me.
here is my conf #F8NEQM. My flight was delayed for 3 hours while my friend waited for me on her bday. Please follow up.
"@USAirways Oh yes, because I had loads of time running to my connecting flight after you delayed me for about 90 minutes..."
@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
@USAirways  ok my 4th try today....giving up at 12.45am after 138 minute hold time. #terrible http://t.co/Ps9Q9RPSiL
Classic
"I slept in the miami airport due to mechanical issues and was given 10,000 bonus miles to try and make it right. #slapintheface"
silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
"for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/5xGnyHGAFz” this is what I hate
", please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm?????"
didn't find them unfortunately :( but he was very helpful and took down my info incase they do get found
My wife and I will be sharing this dreadful experience. Don't pretend UA cares about young girl traveling alone # United Airlines
"“@AmericanAir: @mwangbickler We apologize for your frustrations, Michael. Have you been rebooked?” -got call back after 10 hours. Bad."
called executive platinum desk and got a TWO HOUR call back time... 2.5 hrs Late Flightr still no call and still stuck in Chicago
"that I missed my flight. I had to book this flight extremely last minute due to a family death, there's no excuse for attitude in"
"Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
"@barrettkarabis what a joke you can mai
Trying to get my flight changed through dallas. Calling your number just says thanks for calling and hangs up. Guess I'm stuck
@USAirways 8 hrs of wait time is unbelieavle unaccpetable biggest airline in the world should have failback call centers
I understand they're busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk
please hire an efficiency consultant to manage your PHX baggage checkin. Way to many open kiosks with 100's of ppl waiting
have a prompt for consumers for prompt for customer service instead of having customers on hold for 1.5 hrs
deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.
where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
@_Lucy_May surely much better to let us all share the feedback unless you have something to hide?
"@USAirways &amp; also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail"
@USAirways F623 DEN:PHX. Serious display of poor customer service exhibited by flight crew today.   #newamericanairline #cheapslogannotmotto

5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
"; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions."
"delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS"
"- I'd be happy to hold on the phone, but your phone system is not allowing that and simply hangs up."
@USAirways @hhagerty that's a lie.
@USAirways @AmericanAir. delay and mechanical issues on both my weekend flights. Ridiculous. Will tweet as long as we are delayed
line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
@USAirways It was US 893. The gate was open after about 50 mins waiting. What a great way to finish an 18 hour delayed arrival!!
make sure u insure your luggage as those assholes @ AA take no fricken responsibility...&amp; don't  believe their lies!!!!
I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
@USAirways we might need a plane to get somewhere but just remember that you aren't the only choice #makeovertime#customerserviceplease
no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
@USAirways I'm sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether
Flight is 100% full.
"I was, just very surprised it took over 15 mins. Never experienced anything like that on 1K number"
"@USAirways yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!"
should i continue?
"@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise"
@USAirways on hold 3 hours !!!!!! What's the number to speak to someone this is unacceptable I need to change flights
I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
@USAirways the plane i am on is having mechanical issues. Why cant i get off and get on a new flight? Now i have missed my connecting flight
@USAirways flight 1898 landed over 2 hours ago and they still haven't gotten to the gate.. What's the hold uppp 😭😭 #imtired #wannagohome
"I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the ""T5 experience"" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month."
@USAirways I have been trying to get through to a representative for 7 hours aboout my Cancelled Flightled flight. Have you simply given up?
@USAirways incapable of seating a 2yo and mom together. Toddler in his own row #fail @CNN
still haven't left @BWI. Maybe by the time I'm suppose to fly back to Austin on Tuesday we'll have moved.
no response to DM or email yet.  customer service?
"@USAirways I promise, if I can help it I will nvr fly w/u again. Even if I have 2 pay more $$$ 2 fly w/ sum1 else #badcustomerservice"
flight Cancelled Flighted tonight and was told I won't receive a travel voucher for the inconvenience. Is that really your policy?
or did you mean 24-26?
@USAirways been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full
"@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection… Help!"
the lack of customer service is astounding https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu #2daysofhell
been on hold for 30 min trying to rebook my flight you Cancelled Flightled. Help?!
"+what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +"
@USAirways Been tweeting with the team at who informed me that the problem is that you never sent his bags to them yesterday.
"I need to be at work tomorrow at 8am, therefore that doesn't help.  Direct message faster than calling 800 number? #Backwards"
"@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded."
"@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them."
@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online
wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
@USAirways - I wouldn't need to wait on hold for 6+ hours if your website worked correctly - please respond!
it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
@USAirways Flight 496. How are u going to compensate me for sitting on the tarmac for 90+ mins and missing my PHX - BOS connection?
"@USAirways I did, but it won't help.. Can't believe you wouldn't take full fare for first class and gave away to Platinum Member.. Profits?"
"agent, ""You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full."" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited"
hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
"I guess you have to ""follow"" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send."
when will sw return to customer service?  Business travelers made sw now sw ignores us.
"even followed me, but I still can't get them to answer their phones. Worst. Customer ""service"". Ever. #customerservice #fail"
Also do you have any way to speak to someone on the phone? Your 1-800 # has been hanging up on me all day.
@USAirways where are my bags?
"flight US1562 from RIC2DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday &amp; I was on hold w/ cust. service from 6-10pm EST...4 hours, no answer..."
"@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta"
This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice
How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
"what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?"
"@USAirways after last night in Charlotte NC I'm seriously debating never flying you again. 50 minute on the Tarmac, connection leaves."
"Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight."
I am completely displeased with the service I received on yesterday flying from LGA to ATL.
"3349, was supposed to be in little rock at 10am this morning."
thanks for the DM rescheduling. Unfortunately your operations process at LAX is chaos &amp; the reps refused to print the ticket
why do this to me sending N598JB to UVF today and its a weekday why not a weekend :'(
"Brands: Stop this shit. No, stop. RT Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/sKEbqKtxvX"
@USAirways 3rd connecting flight delayed but still cannot make it &amp; still unable to speak to a real person
@USAirways how is it that my flt to EWR was Cancelled Flightled yet flts to NYC from USAirways are still flying?
you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don't recline.
what I am put off by is the fact that no gate supervisor has tried to come by and communicate with us.
 I did.  They have no idea where it is.
@USAirways  last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged.   No one answers the baggage call line for status?  #chairmanlove
I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
"your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should’ve had yesterday, it’s $514 today. Thanks."
C'mon now. My flight's delayed annnnnd you can't give me a pick?!? I'm about to tweet at or .......
can someone actually either call back or help me figure out how I'm getting home??!
your customer service is lacking and you owe me a @GoPro camera. I also appreciate not being interrupted every time I speak Thanks
@USAirways no your not!
over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man!
she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight
"@USAirways #PHL why does it take an hour to offload bags, especially after taking 30+ min to get a jetway to get off plane after landing?"

"There were plenty of empty seats in coach ""@united: Your dissatisfaction is understood. Crew members traveling for duty are pre-booked on f"""
"just curious, when are you going to to finally learn #customerservice ?"
yes staff were rude  and unempathetic. I needed jacket and tablet by 4 got at 11. If u take carryons cause plane full.don't lose em!
"Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"

"Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks"
@USAirways @HirasmusBidragi will try.. Now stuck on tarmac waiting on gate. :( may miss 9:25 connection #883)
will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can't even make this stuff up.
@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
@united. Once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding
@USAirways I've been on hold for over an hour.  Not doing so well in the customer service department.  #weak
@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
@USAirways yes had to go pick up and pay 40 cab ride very rude employee poor customer service
"@united, UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice &amp; charged me. Who do I need to file claim with?"

"@USAirways - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks"
I couldn't fly you today &amp; it made the trip harder + had to pay for my checked bag. #DevotedyYours but for today. :(
not able to DM you my confirmation number
I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked?
@USAirways 4 hours... 4 hours... FOUR HOURS.  It's like this is a joke to you.
you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
"@USAirways , I am embarrassed for us air and their inability to manage during weather delays.handling of # 4435 is an example"
if I had made as many mistakes as you in as short a period of time. I would I have lost my job at this point!!!

"@USAirways between 3 of us, it is costing over $1000 to get home TODAY for no reason... Where do I send my receipts to be reimbursed?"
@USAirways why didn't you reroute BOS to JAX via DCA through CLT instead forcing an overnight @DCA #passengersLose
diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
"Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9"
"It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."

not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
plus what about food? And taxis?
At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
"@USAirways BF has been stuck in CLT all day. Is the lounge offering free ""This weather sucks &amp; we all want to cry"" tequila shots?"
"promised 4 rooms until Wednesday, (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white?"
"there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened ""do you want to get to SF today"" #fail"
@USAirways Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member.
plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
my baggage is in shannon now so never mind u can work on giving me some $$$ back now
flight UA5631 from SFO to Burbank has been delayed twice now. Still no plane in sight. Get it together.
Sure did go south after breakfast though! Delayed three hours. :( :( :(
were you handing out tickets while I was sleep ?
@USAirways Cool. Now @SweetingR has been told you can't re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race.
you're running 5+ hours behind replying to anyone via Twitter. this is beyond unacceptable. I'm running out of time!
is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
@USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!
"I've spent three hours talking to all different people, most of which couldn't help. I probably won't be using JetBlue again."
"the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost."
"@USAirways never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed."
"how do I talk to an actual person that will help me, and do what you guys should do?"
@USAirways pretty sure we didn't actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu
I fly SWA a lot - ALWAYS purchase EB and NEVER past A30... Rethinking the SWA process.  Very misleading.
thanks for the Cancelled Flightation today. Only airline that's Cancelled Flighted. Lost a customer today.
@USAirways this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service
 soooo are you guys going to leave the seatbelt light on all flight? You can barely call this turbulence :-)
u suck Big Donkey Balls!
"@HDsportsguy yes I did. I hope for an update soon, need those clothes for a meeting tomorrow."
don't you guys have an email address? Just put me on the next available flight from ohare
@USAirways just called reservations.  Cannot change just able to put note on res.  Problem is tsa...
"it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude."
yeah and what are they gunna? Nothing your whole organization is a joke
@USAirways some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative
other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this.  #epicfail
@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
customer service is terrible.Been waiting 6 weeks for a reply to an email. Not helpful at all and keep brushing off problems!
"gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an ""UNMET ARRIVAL""!!"
. I don't like the new schedule. No more nonstops from PHL to FLL or PBI? We are not free to move between those cities. Sad.
if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
now on hold for 2.5 hours waiting to speak to someone about my Cancelled Flightled flight from Philly to ORL
no self help way to put in tsa pre check number for existing reservation. Very annoying. 800 is not reachable.
great. My flight is delayed three hours. Now my friend has to wait for me at the airport for hours on her birthday. 😒👎
"@USAirways wow this airline is a joke, absolutely horrendous customer service. you guys should be ashamed."
@USAirways @DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard
"@British_Airways 2 weeks ago today i arrived in miami and I still don't have my bag, absolute disgrace!"
been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me.
"@USAirways I'm stuck in the airport in fresno trying to beat the storm to pittsburgh, and you guys have offered nothing. HORRID"
 Status match - 2 weeks have gone by and no news.Flt next week - hope flt will count towards requirement.  Cust Svc no help!!!
@USAirways your chairmans phone is down. what other number can i use?
@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
@USAirways already did it. One person said they couldn't do anything another said she didn't know why the first person we talked 2 said that
"@USAirways @nburnside26  U hate delays, too?  But u have her $$ &amp; are holding her hostage!  #GoingForGreatnessFAIL"
is to airlines as @comcast @XFINITY is to cable/internet
"+ besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation."
@dfwairport  Have been trying to get canx flight resched since noon.  got 2 call backs but call disconnects as soon as I answer
delayed another hour
I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
"why do you continually play the ""according to federal regulations"" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service..."
- I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada?
@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
"$25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice"
but you guys should know that musicians are very sensitive about the safety of their instruments when flying. For good reason.
"--(pt 2) and the AA reservations phone number has been less than helpful, telling me to change things online when I can't."
Number or email? That's the purpose of sending you a tweet? @USAirways
this team added 30 mins on turnaround
why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing
"If it's in my backpack, why do I need to see agent?"
@USAirways i dont need to check status of my flight because i was ON the plane and you had a door malfunction. Get it together!!
What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley 😃😃😃
you're almost as bad as @united
just messaged you. Please have someone contact us immediately.
"@USAirways no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho"
"@USAirways I was calling before I left, and as it turns out answered their phones instead and they rebooked my USAir flight."

"@southwestair Landed an hour Late Flight from IND to DEN, and 40+ min Late Flightr, our bags are not here. Not cool."
seriously? System down? No IT?
"the woman working the counter in philly at 630 this am needs to be fired. Due to bad weather, I along with other passengers"
Can i get a refund? I would like to book on a better airline.
#worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!
"@USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting"
is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario
screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about @Skiplagged ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech

@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.
" upon entering plane to 2 @USAirways stewardesses: ""can I have some water?"" ""no we don't do that. please take your seat"""
"called last night, after 10hrs got call back, can I get a one day pass to admirals club? I'm going to be spending 7hrs in DFW"
Stuck on the plane in Charlotte.  Going to miss my connection.  No words from staff. Maybe some damn pretzels?
"booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are €67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff"
so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
yes we did file a report and were treated rather rudely at midway baggage claim. Now we wait 2 days to get our luggage.
"You found my lost luggage, won't bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn't nicer. Terrible service"
My flight tomorrow from SLC to DFW AA304 Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me get there?
@USAirways I have a voucher from a past trip that was delayed. I thought I had to talk to someone on the phone to use it. Is that not true?
"on plane for JFK-&gt;SFO, been sitting here for 1.5 hours waiting for push crew, how is this acceptable?"
@USAirways I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport
"the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting"
@USAirways Total BS... I offered to pay for a full First Class airfare ..Told Sold out.. 3 seats and they gave the seats to others... #crap

"machines are broken, lines are out the door for self service, cust. Support, and bag check in."
any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded
waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink 😕
@USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it.
the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
@SMiles1307 over two hours now.  Ugh we should all get vouchers this is inexcusable ESP after a pre flight check that was ok.
"@USAirways Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided."
Flight 683 last night was #bad4business. Will be a long time before I recommend United to anyone.

"I put it my ""to"" and ""from"" airports, click update and it tells me to put in my ""to"" and ""from"" airports."

Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.

"worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"

"I understand the weather issues. I don't understand how I was not notified of the Cancelled Flightlation, and had to realize it so Late Flight."
has the worst customer service on earth. Will never fly that airline again.
Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future !
@americanair been calling your for 4+ hours to reschedule a flight to #DFW due to weather and your won't even let me stay on hold.....
 any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun
@USAirways so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks
@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
On hold waiting to make special accommodations for my mom who is traveling 1 hour and 24 minutes on hold.  Unacceptable!
 currently in minute 10 of being on hold with cust. service. Do I need to do anything to add a lap child to my reservation?
how nice it would be if you had helpful flight attendants instead of the rude nasty ones you employ. #WhyAreYouYelling
@USAirways Instructions say to CALL. I'm just doing what it said to do.
so u guys Cancelled Flight #bna flights &amp; don't bother 2 alert passengers? What gives?
still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers.
@USAirways so I still need to stay on hold? http://t.co/04SDytT7zd
"what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your ""customer feedback"""
Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
"@USAirways the gate agent said ""it's booked in full. Sorry"" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land."

I called the 800 # and the rep there was pleasant but less than helpful! Told me I was SOL. Train them for consistent #CX!

"@USAirways lack of communication with other offices, the customer, &amp; yall never update ur systems. U guys are 2 established 4 this mess"
A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.

this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
I knew the 3-4 hours sounded odd; missed a flight we hit JFK an hour early for and your gate  attendant told us 3-4 :(
it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
What a really GREAT &amp; FLATTERING story about you! You should be very proud :) http://t.co/oKtUkjY92O (via @ParachuteGuy)
need to learn how to treat people with respect and just a little dignity. #FAIL
.Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!
why would you overnight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can't contact!
@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.

@USAirways Your app and website are trash AF.
DM'd you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag.
only w/ $70 upgrade. Unsure why she can't just switch someone around. I called 24 hrs in advance for this reason.
Pooling and gifting are completely different.  I shouldn't have to be charged $375 to send points.  Its disgusting.
@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
your staff at JFK airport are discussing the way we we're left stranded
@Stone9956 Do you dislike delays when they're caused by YOUR crew forgetting to load bags &amp; lazy pilot wanting duty day to end?
can u see what's holding up flt 1002 bags? One bag came out nothing else for 10 minutes

@USAirways not too impressed with your airlines but I would feel a lot better flying with if you upgraded me up to first class tomorrow
I appreciate the speedy response. But the longer you delay the more inconvenience you put on your customers. Please nix change fee!
"If SNA curfew causes diversion, do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now, pilot not sure if we have time."

right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.

if I wait I'll lose the flight. So frustrating.
"You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?"
@USAirways our hold up now is the captain that was Late Flight...his bag doesn't fit.
Another customer non service from you. If we waited for you to solve the problem we would miss the funeral. You suck!
it doesn't allow me to hold. That's the problem.
@EdPlotts don't bother trying to get anywhere with their customer service team either as take 2+ months and counting to reply
yes I have
"said they haven't started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can't find $100 outfit. 😒"
"If this is customer service, then please call me."

yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail
@USAirways stuck in cae need reFlight Booking Problems for next flight possibly dm for more info
an hour at baggage carousel and still no luggage?? Nail in the coffin.
She could even see that I had tried to make the transaction but wouldn't offer me the price I'd tried to purchase it at.
I called the EP line and 4 hours Late Flightr I was called back.  I sat on hold for over a hour to US Airways and then cut off
I'm smashed into a window by the giant guest sitting next to me. #4386. No way this guy should have been given 1 seat.
Would it be ok to send you a DM asking a few questions because i'm deaf and been on hold so long?
is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
"hey, it's 4am, guess what I'm doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports"
agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via DM?
AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
When will your phone agents be able to give the correct departure times for CUN? When can we checkin online for international?
thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance.
"nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
"@USAirways overloads small plane with extra baggage and then. Has to take them off... Poor execution #4435, 75 minute delay..."
thx for showing me that your Twitter appreciates me more than your employees. Sure another airline would like my $1300 #nohotel
"Cancelled Flights your flight then sends you an email saying ""think about your next flight..."" #customer #outrage http://t.co/KkwiwI97A4"
no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
I booked a flight on my phone and then never got a confirmation email. How would I go about getting that?
"@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us."
@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
@USAirways phone support rebooked but orig flt was Late Flight. Made it!
"I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy?"
@MurphyJulie it took them 6 hours to call me back. Then it disconnected twice. 😢 I'll never get back to work
thank you. I was given this same reply 2 years ago. Can you direct me to an area I can learn more about the improvements?
your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
final destination was booked through United but with quantas. United has not yet contacted Auckland. I am unaware of case ID number
Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
"Worst airline. You Cancelled Flight flight, don't let me know, I wait on hold 30 mins, told to enter callback for middle of the night?!!"
@USAirways waited for 3 hours NO LUGGAGE line too long left airport when flight Cancelled Flighted WHERE does luggage GO? On hold for 1 hour so far
is REALLY getting on my nerves !! 😡😡 #nothappy
I need #United to be a better airline!!

That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
" Called JB 3 times!Everytime, Auto Vmsg:""your wait time should not be longer than 9 mins"" waited longer than 18 mins and no answer!"
really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight &amp; -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket
needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
the free wifi makes up for the television not working... It's staticy #ithelpsabit
 too bad you say it takes 10 to 14 days via YOUR confirmation email. When I inquired after 3 weeks you claim 6 to 8 weeks!
already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
"and even worse, by the time you responded to my tweets I took two flights over five hours. And that was the quickest response!"
@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
"Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!"
right on cue with the delays👌
it's GTSVYB. It says it's Cancelled Flightled when I try to check.
"""the extra care airline"". #unitedairlines they don't care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don't have 1"
how are you going to rectify this? Please direct me to your complaints department #stickingToDelta

you hung up on me again.
@USAirways how about an update with real information?still waiting on Tarmac in Philadelphia.
@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
"14 hours????  Sorry don't get it. Oh well. Screw the weekend in Az right?  Eat the hotel, no problem."
been rebooked for tomorrow. You failed to put me on DL flight today despite my asking and available seat. DL still available
it's sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What's the real reason?
I can probably find some of them. Are the ticket #s on there?
and waiting
I requested my boarding pass to be texted to me but I still haven't received it.
weather delays aren't your fault today but getting to hotel with two soaked suitcases and no dry clothes stinks frustrated
My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
@USAirways 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported.
@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
@USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
now we are all stuck on the plane after landing because crew unable to figure it out
@USAirways This is ridiculous. You delayed my husband's flights &amp; made him miss his connection. Told him to leave his bags. Sent him (1/3)
quick ? Why is a person traveling w  a mosaic not get the green tag? Doesn't make sense I end up waitin 4 my sons bag anyway :/
thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.
"@USAirways already did. I travel for a living, no help at all that it will take 3-4 weeks for any repair. And I have to pay to ship to TX."
flight home Cancelled Flightled today.  Any way we can get another flight to NYC from Texas? 4 hour wait for a call back from airline
"yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you."
- answer the phones.  Trying to change a reservation and haven't been able to get a human to pick up in two days.
"no need, I know the status, you Cancelled Flightled instead of delaying the flight."
 i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
"@USAirways my friends are stuck at KPHL and not getting any help from anyone, can you guys contact them please?"
@USAirways now in a black hole of your phone system
 trying to book a flight with you guys and your website won't let me... about to lose my business
Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
@USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
"hey ho its not me losing any money (only you) just next make sure you stick to the ""flyers right's booklet"""
20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable!

 #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
@USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE
Still on hold. Way to suck.
@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
"no vouchers 4 Cancelled Flighted flight due 2 weather. Today's issue, broken tire. No vouchers cause tire was broken by weather. #nomoAA"
your gate agent re-routed an impossible itinerary and we had to find a new airline to get us home. Super bummed about this
@USAirways if I try and call your reservations line will someone answer the phone now or will I be on hold for an hour again?
"flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please."

"we were told when we checked in, as soon as we were allowed to, that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle."
no apology? Cool.
why are you literally the worst?
WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!
@USAirways you're right it's not fun. Especially when I don't have much of a choice. Lol. #curvygirltravels

employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service.
"my flight was Cancelled Flightled, leaving tomorrow morning. Auto rebooked for a Tuesday night flight but need to arrive Monday."
you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
@macario2 but you are Late Flight again!! Again and again! Where are the crew?
@USAirways but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes
Not even on the bag status...will take actions against this company is incredible how irresponsible are with the costumer

"@USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment."
@USAirways  I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out

@USAirways well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks
"@_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It's a small airport, so whatever."
where are our luggages? With a group and over 20 luggages are lost

 everything was fine until you lost my bag
I was just called abt my flight Cancelled Flightlation- a flight that was Cancelled Flightled at 10:30a Sunday. Two 4:00a calls are not okay.
UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED. DELAY AFTER DELAY. STOP MESSING WITH MY LIFE.
"right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?"
"Was going for the weekend for friend's birthday, so no point in reFlight Booking Problems."
@usairways I've been on hold for over an hour only b/c my CC miles aren't showing up. What a mediocre combo of cc &amp; airline #SwitchingBoth
@USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing.

fcuk you. Shit service. You got no fans.
@USAirways you're the only airline that's not open sooner. It's not a confidence booster.
@USAirways I would be willing to pay anything to change a flight! @AllegiantTravel does not! help!
"come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip."

" Trying to reset my password, email never arrives. Help?"
"If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it."
they sent her a letter and said they would talk to the stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
I have been denied. Not sure how you charge $150 one way then $25 on way hime
"@USAirways And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!"
A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
"You didn't call, did you. Try it, and then you'll understand.  It's not possible to reach an agent,I don't know what else to do"
"I understand that. But 14 hours Late Flightr, I still haven't heard a word! How can you plan your week with no zero information!"
@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease
my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
you need a bag bouncer. Get it together
I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
"@czamkoff It's all about profit, and they don't really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed"
is there any way you could put me up in a hotel for the night?? If not I'm having to sleep at the airport again tonight.

"@usairways you made us miss our flight, first class now I can't even enter the admirals club.  Not happy  dm me to fix this."
@USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out.
now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another???
what's the point? So I can wait for another 6 weeks. U r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone
if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue

I know that. Thanks for the standard reply.

@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking

how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat?  WTF.
@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
anyone awake? Paying for wifi on iPhone when need to be using it on laptop. Logout option for wifi in flight? Time is wasting!
the one at 11:30am? My app still shows it as on time!
I've been on hold with customer service for over an hour. Can you help?!
 You guys charged me $100 to reschedule a flight that was then Cancelled Flighted and are now refusing to refund it. What's the deal?
@USAirways I've been on hold for 30 minutes and counting. #unacceptable
why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
"- our baggage motto: we don't cover that. Small tear, ripped seam, snow soaked, busted zippers - SORRY http://t.co/LHwFBKFynI"
I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
umm unexpected?? Unexpected meaning you guys didn't know you had a major staff shortage ??
I'll give a reward for whoever finds and returns to me on Thurs when I fly back thru @dfwairport. I ❤️ these earrings!!
"Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead!"

@USAirways I need someone from management to contact me I was flying to a funeral won't make it now to add to my pain they want me 2 pay

thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
"typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
@USAirways Seriously. You can't tweet and let people know that you've got customers that have been on hold for 5 HOURS??!!
" so far all I am getting is ""maybe your bag will come today. We don't know."" Website says ""status unknown""- can you help?"
"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."

would be hard to be worse than last time but I'm sure you'll give it a shot
@USAirways  you Cancelled Flightled both my flights and refused to give a voucher despite no flights for 2days. @USAirways #neveragain
"offered me a cot to sleep on?After they Cancelled Flightled my flight. A fucking cot. What about a hotel, like you're supposed to provide"
"@USAirways Flight 2069 from JFK to Charlotte, then 3750 from Charlotte to Birmingham. 2 previous flights to HSV were Cancelled Flightled."

Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
@USAirways 2 hours and counting. ..what kind of travel voucher do I get for this??
when you enter every contest for #DestinationDragons and lose :(
it most certainly was not.
how comes no one has answered my calls or emails?
its flight #218 of that matters to you all. Hell next we all won't get our luggage properly transferred #facepalm #smh
Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi

@USAirways standing in line with 100 people all looking to do the same
pleaseeee resume direct flights from FLL to PHL. I don't want to fly with anyone else 😩😫😢
@USAirways spoke with your reps in NH and PA. Very poor communications. Bags still sitting in Philly. TRAIN YOUR STAFF
"nothing, you have done enough."
@USAirways  you Cancelled Flighted &amp; rescheduled my flight &amp; still getting updates &amp; can't find my current flight on my account http://t.co/8Je1h3666w
@USAirways Can you help me with a refund.  the phone guy couldn't help.  The website won't let me submit a reply.
"@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5"
@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
@gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
very frustrated. Bought early bird at 6:30am on day tickets were released and got mid-B ticket. Spend $50 for nothing
@andyellwood @delk lol. I was sure I'd wake up to more of a response than this half-thought auto tweet. hope you made it out.
since you don't care about what happens to your passengers on your planes we will now be contacting the Police Dept
Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.

who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
its 2015. How can my flight from a major city already be Cancelled Flightled 24 hours before departure due to weather??  Backup planes??
The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.

you delayed me for 15 hours in Chicago and still managed to lose my bag! Really not happy
"@USAirways worst service at Reagan Int. I rarely post about a company or service, but I am so annoyed. Not weather reLate Flightd…incompetence."

@USAirways why does this flight keep getting delayed Late Flightr and Late Flightr?
"continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh."

She got to the gate just in time to watch the plane push back. 5 minutes was all she needed. Glad we’ve relatives nearby.
  You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
" also, gave up after 1 hr 32 minutes on hold. Maybe put a few more people on it?"
"@USAirways I thought about moving a lot of business over too, but first impressions count.. Glad it was miles and not cash."

so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled my flight then put me on a flight the next day.I need help from somebody other than a robot. PLEASE!!! Much appreciated
loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
ok so why is it Late Flight? And for that matter why was my flight 4491 Cancelled Flighted this morning? I've been in YYZ since 5 AM.
I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight.
 How do I reschedule my Cancelled Flightled flights online? The change button is greyed out!

"@USAirways not going as planned is an understatement. My flight was just changed AGAIN. If it weren't for a family emergency, I'd Cancelled Flight."

Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.

2nd Late Flight flight today
loves to respond to positive tweets but they ignore problems w/ customers. Just ask NOLA musician @j_beatz247 about that. #shameful
I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
"Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
you Cancelled Flightled my flight to EWR. Flt 3076. U also Cancelled Flightled flights to LGA. Yet is flying on time to both. WTH??

@usairways - thanks for the 5+ hour flight from PIT to PHX with zero entertainment. Guess why I have a quarter million + miles on Delta

mins and no answer. My wife and baby need to get on that flight. She arrived 2 hrs prior. Please help. Venetia Crook
you do realize my wife is waiting on a delayed flight at this very moment.  I'm not sure I understand your tweet.
" thanks for response! Crew has been VERY patient with us, but they are also frustrated. Wouldn't be so bad but airport is closed!"
at some point u need to tell passengers what is going on. At Jfk waiting to get on flight it is a mess.
 got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience.
U said 15mins to Take Off and now we were told 1hr more delay &amp; possible Cancelled Flightlation. How do U plan to rectify this? #Frustrated

"You're both equally terrible, and I'm going to fight until I get complete satisfaction for how we were mistreated"
@USAirways What's the seat assignment policy? Why let us choose a seat only to change it on us two weeks Late Flightr?
unhappy with your new mileage rules :( - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere
the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay

served the nastiest food Ive ever seen yesterday.Rubber chicken in slime. The ENTIRE cabin sent their food back.FAs can confirm
received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?

- Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp; I am stuck outside sec
"no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation"
lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow
just wondering if the website is having issues today. Trying to book a flight with my visa I always use and its rejecting it.
Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
"you think I haven't tried that multiple times?? The ""status"" of my bag is that it should've been here YESTERDAY. So disgusted."
"@USAirways ""ma'am if you have a complaint you should visit our customer service desk"" {sees line ~45 people deep}"
dont really know what that means but this isnt the best first-time-flying-w-a-16mo old experience. likelihood of addtl delays 2nt?
@USAirways 799 from AMS to PHL today- 3 of 4 flight attendants were downright rude and hostile and made the 8+ hour flight even worse.
those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
@USAirways thanks for the worst customer service on the face of the earth. I loved the 5+ hrs on hold along w 2 Cancelled Flightled flights
from groupA to group C. We have never got to sit next to each other on any south west flight not even on our honey moon
It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
Yes. Your service in GUC sucks. Your gate agent pushed a passenger and has been rude to everyone since we got here.
"Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you ""can't do anything"" #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7"
"I can't!!!  No one can't get to ""hold"".  You can't get past the automated reply.  It hangs up on you.  #FRUSTRATED"
I just need a place to sleep when I land without accommodations in PLS @AmericanAir!
“@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way ASAP. ^ML”:3:15 &amp; still not resolved
@jetblue terrible landing on 915
in my 30 years of flying I have never been so pissed off.  To many incidents for just one flight.
"There is no option just to Cancelled Flight? I don't want to change flight, I want to Cancelled Flight."
why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition
"@USAirways that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding."
@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
"I've been trying to change a Thursday flight and there's a ridiculous wait time on the phone, and your website isn't helping"
"@USAirways I made the change online, but couldn't check-in online, so had to call (3 hrs on hold btw). Shouldn't have been charged $25"
I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
that's not what I asked :)) I'm looking to change a Flight Booking Problems for 03.03. Can you help
better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
don't see response!
been on hold to rebook a flight to CMH for 1.5 hrs. Your rebook website is crashed.
how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
@USAirways I did at 7 pm! Still no bag..
apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?
sadly this wasnt just due to mother nature investigate this incident and your employees at sfo. Terrible customer experience
 after 38 minutes on the phone I'm given another number to call now still on hold with them. http://t.co/1ZT2kEe8up
I was flying from Ft Lauderdale FL to Seattle WA on the 02/28/2015 until the 03/03/2015 and they don't want to honor my flight.
@USAirways might possibly be THE WORST airline ever! I think it's time to brush up on customer service! #sorude
I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice
Weather was not involved.
" just landed in LAX, an hour after I should of been here. Your no Late Flight bag check is not business travel friendly #nomorevirgin"
@USAirways I never made a reward reservation becuase no one ever answered the phone. The online one I made got Cancelled Flighted and I can't change
@usairways I purchased a $49 upgrade on a flight 2 weeks ago and you gave it to someone else but I have not received a refund. Is this SOP?
"Club DEN, East or West, both are disgusting. http://t.co/XijYrPsLZK"
I booked it on US Airways site. Don't see a Cancelled Flight link :(
 at fort launder dale and the gate agent can't switch flights to an earlier flight but we can on our phone...ridiculous
@USAirways 502 M-phx Im still on The plane waiting And waiting
@philpete wonder if that's the pilot tweeting you back? Is it legal to tweet and fly? What if the plane in front stops suddenly?
you guys there? Are we on hour 2 of our phone hold at 3am bc of volume or short staffing?
": Unhappy with United's service
"worst air line ever, you have no compassion of the handicapped"
"@loganex except if you call now you'll get the same message. Trust me, I've tried."
@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
"@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)"
"- stuck on the runway, again. Delayed on Wednesday. Not a good way to take care of your loyal customers."
Is this a serious thread. Maybe you guys should re-read it. #fail
"wasn't trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee"
that I would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for Otis I would be still sitting at ORD
@USAirways I paid for my seat.  I expect to be able to use my full seat
@USAirways I have contacted them but only got an automated response that won't give me the code.
@USAirways I'm tired of paying for luggage &amp; less than stellar customer service @AmericanAir. #notafanofyourmerger
"worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!"
"just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100"
"first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan."
What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
" got a flight (we were told) for 4:50 today..,checked my email and its for 4;50 TOMORROW. This is unacceptable."
I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks
I’ll play it by ear. I know that you are doing your best. Buy some chewey oatmeal cookies for your customer care folks.
"I fly American because of family but severe weather excuse so I can't call to make change, why have a computer if u cant modify"
@USAirways @Beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002
"so, when your plane doesn't work the luxuries I paid for go away but you keep my money? I need that biz model."
"Too Late Flight, damage has been done. Easily the worst airline experience of my life. Missed two connecting flights &amp; days of work. #UA49"
what's up with these delays?! Throw some priority boarding my way &amp; I'll forgive you!! 👍 #southwest #southwestairlines
"on SFO-&gt;AUS UA343 2/17, IS9JX1; my seat appears to have had a mite problem. Dr recently confirmed over 50 bug bites were mites"
@USAirways this is got to be the worst service I've ever seen with an airline. 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. Currently flight delayed
hilarious
I just checked the app and it said my flight had been moved back a day? No explanations why. No answer on the 800 number.
All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman
@USAirways was on hold for about 45 minutes after speaking 2 lady at the airport counter. Gave up
"@USAirways yeah , I have been expecting The same for 3 hours"
@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
"Your AA3465 staff are refusing to allow a woman to board. She was here at 8 for 8:16 departure. Sign still ""Now Boarding""..."
we had four scheduled flights on this reservation and literally did not take one! Unreal
@JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
"@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “We don’t care. We’re automated."""
@USAirways lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA.
then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
@USAirways i have been tryng to rsrv a flight over the phone over the past 4 days and keep getting an automated message to call back?!?!?!
"@USAirways I don't mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn't have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food!"
.Don't post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with 20+ comments saying the same thing. @harris
I had a SJC to JFK departing 10:55pm tonight. I have to now change my whole schedule. Can we get a sort of refund for this?
Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let's make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks
seriously what's with the slow #wifi on this flight! If the speed was going to change for the worse then the price shouldn't go up!
haha I did. They said it wasn't their fault somehow? You guys r a joke
"after all, the plane didn’t land in identical or worse) conditions at GRK according to METARs."
@USAirways how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707?
@USAirways @acnewsguy can you give me a # for US Air in philly to talk to a real person? Acarl4@hotmail.com
Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
yes. Hung up and called a different number.
flight 1019 I need 2 b on the first flight out frm MIA 2 TPA. I'm extremely irritated. I've been at this airport for 5.5 hrs.
@USAirways why the hell did you overbook a plane when you knew people actually had seat assignments. #inept #uncaring #piss poorplanning
"time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United"
"@USAirways cost me a day of vacation ($350 hotel stay), day of dog boarding, and a day of airport parking."
could you add me to that list? Been on hold for an hour 15
what's going on with flight 669 and how many free trips will I get from this epic inconvenience @anku http://t.co/pEUc0BMij9
Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
"still awaiting a reply from ur customer services?  18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines"
"@usairways told no gates open at #ORD, needed to wait 20mins. Still waiting after about 4 mins."
the flt TO ORD is correct.  Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly
30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
I tried to return to orig booked flt. told overbooked.Gng to diff dest.Feel like we were switched on purpose bec of overbook.
"does a great job of answering public messages. Direct private messages, not so much."
@USAirways how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating
@USAirways this travel day sucks but Malcome K at gate 39 rocks.  This guy is the brand you want to be. Replicate his approach and style.
FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
"@USAirways Almost half hour on hold.  My cell phone battery is dying.  Thanks for your loyalty from a ""Platinum"" member"
Does anyone ever answer your phone? #poor
we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers
Report was filed but would like to support some active searching.  Feels pretty passive now.  Info on computer is precious.
" 4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight  50 min and still counting..."
@AmericanAir-everyone: its been weeks&amp;those dickheads @ AA hadn't contacted me...they lost my checked bag &amp; carryon and haven't offer to pay
"stop sending me back to ""customer relations ""I have hand written a letter to them, send in a letter, called them, no help!!"
"poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage"
I sent you a dm with my file reference number.. I just want to know if someone has located my bag even if it's not here yet.
"AA2334 Second week in a row delayed, due to mechanical issues. All the sleet outside and yet we're stuck changing a tire"
"come on, reopen 1285 at ORD and clear your growing DC backlog"
work would be much better with my lesson plans and music for my classes today.
"All followers please note that @USAirways is not taking customer service calls, nor responding by helping via soc. media #dontflyusairways"
as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.
I never got a Cancelled Flightlation text from this morning either #bushleague or a number to call #weakservice
@USAirways already spent 60 mins today handling this for my minor child. Shame on you for treating a 15 year old girl like this.
"just a heads up, this page no longer exists http://t.co/NsJWVTTjGo"
@USAirways thx for delayed checkin on noon flt to mia then forcing me to take Late Flightr flts which were delayed. Cincy to Miami in 13 hrs! #fast
 question: is it not possible to book a seat for an infant under 2? It's not giving me the option but we want a seat for him.
my pts expired. I made a prchase @ an online retailer to b told by SW that those won't show for 6-8 wks so too L8 2 keepmy pts
@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?
You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
took our carryon bag with essential attire for a life changing interview tomorrow &amp; it's not here; can we expect compensation?
@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
@USAirways been on hold way to long!  Is this the best level of service you can provide? - one hour+ is too long!
has the worst customer service out of any airline company. #dontflythem
"@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service."
@USAirways - been on hold for more than 2.5 hours - this after not getting through after 2 hours on hold this morning with no answer - help!
Why did I have to stand at baggage claim for an hour waiting for a bag that you knew never made it on to the plane?
"I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
#unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
@USAirways no you call me.
"@jetblue having trouble signing in to TrueBlue today, despite right credentials. getting ""We are not able to sign you in"" msg."
overbooked by FIFTY people?!? the worst.
not if its travel Credit you used to buy and it expires on the day you find a lower rate
they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
@USAirways Our flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; chaos abounds. I am in good humour. Please give me free everything to appease me.
can @Sagerooski &amp; I use your luggage scale to measure our weight loss? One scale for each foot @ home is not accurate anymore.
be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before returning.
the last 4 times I've arrived @LASairport our gate has been blocked by a slow to depart plane leading to 30-60 min delays
super disappointed today. First time we've had to stress and now book a flight on another airline while at the airport
"I would understand if weather was the issue, but bc of airline maintenance I had to sleep on an airport floor and lose an entire day"
requested a call back at 1am. My Cancelled Flighted flight through DFW shouldn't take this long to reroute. You're Customer Service lacks
how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?
here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?

Hi-My flight (BNA to LGA) was Cancelled Flighted this morning--#1814. Looks like other flights out of BNA are taking off. Any chance?
- flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn't an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven't waited less than 20min in years
how come you're responding to everyone else and not me #wtf
@USAirways no my flight plans have been delayed until tuesday due to your computer crash
booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.

I need HELP!  I'm trying to Cancelled Flight a flight before it takes off but I can't get a hold of ANYONE because all lines are busy.
No. I was told I got put on another flight and that I would get an email. Still haven't gotten one yet.
" I spoke with a representative that offered no solution, I am a loyal customer who flies on @VirginAtlantic as well"
ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn't leaving till 1220
"I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. http://t.co/LoLuWfCi11"
my SIL bought tix for us to NYC. We were told at the gate that her cc was declined. Supervisor accused us of illegal activity.
your airline should have a better system to Inform your clients when their flights are Cancelled Flightled last min. 😒👺 we have schedules too
customer service what's That???
loves Cancelled Flightling tickets and not telling their customers #flyunited
".it will be because I'm moving to because of talk, no service"

@USAirways would you consider honoring the original fare price if I were to try Flight Booking Problems the ticket again?
don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.
You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
@USAirways can you please train your mechanics? Teach them to bring the tools to fix the plane with them and not leave them in the hanger.
"@USAirways ...2 hours on the plane, they at least got us on a direct flight a couple hours Late Flightr on United"
"nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
the gate agent said our original plane got de-icing fluid in the engine that created a short so they took the plane out of service
you have such a confusing web site/complicated ordering process. This is why I typically fly @SouthwestAir.

i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
not having pillows or blankets or a flight home for 40 people does bad things to my hair
"@USAirways If you believe in keeping your customers happy, especially after a mistake was made on your part..."
if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
"The point of the pic: If your reps struggle with the merger this much, imagine how it is for the public! http://t.co/hQdB5IRuVg"
YOU FUCKING SUCK
@nrhodes85: look! Another apology. DO NOT FLY @USAirways
"“@AmericanAir:  ""Jason, you'll end up missing your connection. Please see our DFW agents for assistance.” Nope! Hasn't taken off yet, still!"
Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement
"can't link my flight from last week to my TruBlue account and 1800 num isn't answering..don't make me fly again, dont do it!"
"Nice ""partners"" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R"
@USAirways u guys suck
@USAirways Does your company see passengers as customers or just $$$?
to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
@USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that
"@naomi_cooper Are you out of your mind, AA? What is the point of this Twitter acct? Form letters in 140 characters or less?"
That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats
why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
help? Invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay. Maybe then you would not disappoint.
@TheNateK I submitted a complaint via that link in Dec. &amp; followed up in Jan. NEVER HEARD BACK! #badcustomerservice
 Flight from BOS &gt; LAS tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. No notification; wait times are 1+ hour. Will you rebook on another airline?
"2 1/2 hours Late Flight, but I made it to sf! Maybe you can help me get on an earlier flight on Sunday :)"
"ruined my day &amp; start trip SFO to GIG. both legs changed, lost my paid upgrade &amp; 200 1st class seat &amp; moved me from Econ + to Econ"
an update on flight 5979 would be great!
"because of you, I am doing the one thing I tried to avoid. Thank you for sending me to baggage claim."
"appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out?"
@USAirways 5534. That's the flight I was placed on after original flight to Charlotte was Cancelled Flightled.  Now 5534 is on 1hr delay
@USAirways just hung up on me again.  Another waste of an hour of my time.  How am I supposed to book a one way award flight?  #badwebsite
I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
I've spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more.
Two delays.  A little proactive communication goes a long way. #howhardcanthatreallybe?

"@USAirways sucks. Delayed my mom's flight 2X, Cancelled Flightled it, delayed her flight again today,all for mech. issues.She had 2 sleep in airport!"
Being old I will miss my connection and can sleep at OAK or get a hotel on my own dime rubs me the wrong way. I wasn’t Late Flight.
@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
@USAirways Can someone please answer my call. I have been waaaaaaiting!!!
is the company from hell with NO consideration for customers that give it hundreds of millions of dollars per year #SMH
oh and now your company has caused us to lose an entire day of our vacation in Cancun. De Boarded waiting for another plane
@USAirways who runs the show at the airport have a boarding pass says us airways and I have to wait in American line #yousuck
"missing out on over 6,000 points in one account. They're now spread over four assuming I create accounts for them"
@USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.
any particular reason it's 20+ minutes and counting to speak to a human being?
"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
why don't you have driver service to get employees to work in bad weather like hospitals etc #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@USAirways hello! I never received a confirmation code for my flights (though they are confirmed--so says the automated reply). Any ideas?
Flight Cancelled Flighted 2nd time. Can't reach agent to reschedule. Can you call me?
they were no where to be found at Midnight Last Night! I would think the agent in LAX could have relayed that info.Bag on flt
very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
"I would love to say the same but it's not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll"
You Cancelled Flight my flight and there’s no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc @Delta
"Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks"
@usairways Ok thank you…I call from Spain to US for seating assistance!
@44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
"..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
@staralliance the B gates are very far though
what about for us that cant get to the states they are playing for the hunt? Any DestinationDragons tickets left?Even just one
@USAirways this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn't left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline
"Cancelled Flightled my direct flight Newark-Brussels last night, now 7 hours behind schedule. In EU compensation would be a given, but in US?"
stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
"A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
@USAirways REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea?
yes there is when you keep getting the same robotic answer.
so u Cancelled Flight our flight to PHX bc of SDF weather but flights 2 the NE from SDF are still going on?! WTF? http://t.co/NGG3N0wIaR
@USAirways it's flt 4827 to ELM - still no gate and still have to make it thru customs

"Its not that I wasn't offered ""perks"" by @USAirways.  I ASKED and was told, ""NO."" #thenewamerican"
its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
@USAirways was on the phone for over an hour waiting without an answer. 😩
our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
@USAirways so how about some help with suggested time I could call to avoid such long wait time
"the communications seems to be an issue too, no?"
@USAirways also your employees were LESS then helpful when @Jack_Kairys was checking his bag. Two just left their desks completely (1/2)

@USAirways thank you for blowing my vacation. Couldn't get me anywhere today to make my reservation and also lost 2 bags of mine!
@USAirways thanks for telling me my flight was on time when the plane was broken. You're an inferior airline.
we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.

"sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. hates us all."

@USAirways problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways  5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight
strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
"@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days."
"yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves."
I'm trying to make a reservation with a &lt; 2 year old lap child. Don't see any option online. How do I proceed with reservation?

"€202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots?"
.Advised GAs and pilot of my flight. Too bad no one took action.
Apparently mechanics had to be flown in to fix some planes...not the most assuring sign
yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
baggage woman said it was in Blatimore and would be on a plane this morning. Now they can't find it. WTF!???
I have and been denied! I called and got hung up on. Did speaks with manager on second call
very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
@USAirways thanks for three Cancelled Flightled flight and making us go from raleigh to charlote to lexington to philly. istead of raleigh to philly
thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest!  Get more agents at sfo 25!
spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.
you can't change my flights and not have enough operators to handle calls.... #unacceptable #AmericanAirlines
@USAirways I didn't take my original flight. I was suppose to arrive last night than by 2:00pm today. Didn't get in til 5
@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.

can't get thru to anyone on phone
@USAirways she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best!
I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
this merger with @USAirways @usairwis a cluster of inefficiency and misinformation.  When is it going to be done?
@USAirways thanks for being so bad you make a two day train trip look appealing!!
#Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals A&amp;C. #Flyingainteasy

fyi the link in your baggage incident email redirects to a 404 on mobile. The link auto changes on mobile. Desktop works fine.
I understand that but I'm hoping I can rectify this in advance. I would call but I am in AUH. I just need my one checked bag.

why is the buffalo flight so Late Flight?
"Lines may be extra long or security slow, but seems your employees too quick to blame customers who don't arrive 3-4 hours ahead @JetBlue"
She seems a little preoccupied - that's why I'm bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer.
we are never going to get to out gate at this rate.
Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
"how is tkt in the A grp for a cxld flight gets stuck at the back of the Cs when your site, phone and agents took 1h to rebook"

Im just praying you get me home alive
What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :(
staff was overall awful through multiple airports would have switched airlines if another flight was available

I'm at the airport right now and your people didn't know how to react and help me with this situation. Very frustrated.
"my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been Cancelled Flighted, what should i do?"

"I'd say most of the public can't extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can't honor?"
I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
@usairways 3rd time cut off after 10+ minutes on hold with Chairmans desk?!??? Wth how are we supposed to rebook Cancelled Flightled flights?!?!?
@USAirways sadly that didn't help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there! Major strike against me!!!
"I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!"
Fastest response all day. Hour on the phone: never got off hold. Hour in line: never got to the Flight Booking Problems desk.
Priority baggage evidently means it comes out last
@USAirways I've been on hold to change a date on a ticket for over 3 hours. Can someone please assist me? Unacceptable.

@americanair never fails to disappoint. waiting at jfk an hour after scheduled take off and still no word on departure
... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate  ..shows total miss  management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment
@USAirways delayed depart bc ur flight attendant wasn't there. Then after landing took 3 hrs to get a gate. Now it's another he and NO bags
Cancelled Flighted my flight. Went with another airline 2 leave 2day. They Cancelled Flighted also. Called JetBlue &amp; got same flight but now $250 more👺

please improve business extra flight reservation process. can't book online?  what century are we in? 25 min+ on hold
why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
You failed. That's the answer. Please don't justify otherwise.
"@USAirways Gave up after more than 2 hours on hold. Still need that receipt; last time it was promised, it never arrived. Help?!"

@usairways is your clt departures delayed? Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt
Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done.
"Felt a bit like they were adding insult to injury, since we'll be in terminal 5 for seven hours until the next flight :/"
We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
You guys are just being disrespectful at this point... learned my lesson about this airline
If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears!
Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
"If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky"
Your gate attendants in ABQ are awful as was your service. You should be ashamed. Terrible experience here from start to finish
"really? That's it? Not even a ""we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time"""
@USAirways Official time of call 3 hours 10 minutes but must add for 7 minutes your reservation agent was extremely professional and helpful
"changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. @BA_USA had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days &amp; no change yet"
Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
are you guys alive? i've been on hold for 25 minutes and counting.....
The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled
yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
has to be the worst airline in the world #yousuck #horrible #Oscars2015
 2/2 You took cost for both flights out of my bank account. Now I can't get a refund for 2 weeks? I have been a loyal customer.
thx for losing my bag. How hard is it to care for a bag w PRIORITY on it?why do u cont to not care for EP's?
@USAirways Fuck you
"@USAirways have been trying to call customer service since 9pm. After an hour, was disconnected. Spoke to no one"

try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere
I have been on hold w/customer service line for 68 minutes.  This after I was on phone with an agent for 35 min b/f call droped
Maybe stop telling people the wrong info on your customer service calls.
Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
trying to rebook flight. On hold for 23 mins before disconnected and now almost 40 mins? Unbelievable. http://t.co/0BJNz4EIX5
@USAirways nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold.  Sorry #minefits

@USAirways by far the worst airline in history. I'll never ever fly your garbage again

"@USAirways Cancelled Flights flight Tampa to Philadelphia today due to runway conditions yet tonnes of USAirways flights landing there today, explain!"
is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head
The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
I was on hold for 30 minutes &amp; no one knows how to win these tickets that you're still handing out? #DestinationDragons
what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
 my group got their Cancelled Flightlation fees waived but I can't because my ticket is booked for 2/18? Your reps were no help either 😡
HELP NEEDED ! #complaint ticketed passenger with no available seats scheduled to leave Late Flightr today
@USAirways Just got off Int. Flight #799. Your Intentionally rude staff made for a horrible 8hr+ flight on an unsuitable plane.
"yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations"
4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
am on hold for the 2nd time today. Need help with confirming the new flights you arranged for me. Can you expedite this?
1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.
@USAirways ok...i know doors close ~10 minutes before takeoff. stop telling me my flight will leave in 20 minutes when we haven't boarded.
can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
just called that number and left message. Are you at to pass along message to team too?
"Thanks for the terrible service! Stranded in MDW for 2 days, &amp; now can't find confirmation for rebooked flight from MKE."
.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
"@USAirways fight was delayed 3 hrs in MCO, now I'm stuck in Philly with a standby ticket, flight 4009. Solution needed."
@USAirways horrible cust service exp at DIA today. Wife waited 3 hrs on the plane b/f flight 695 was Cancelled Flightled. Still waiting for bags.
how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail
it's ridiculous that I just got home and I was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc I am HELLA tired
you guys need better communication to your customers. This is rude and unprofessional.
I'm not sure why I expected anyone to be here http://t.co/bnFlHPXtmw

won't see my money again after their poor service    should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue???
"our #FoodAllergy community. IF you want our continued loyalty, you need to do better than that. Perhaps some training is in (2/3)"
what incentive do I have to give you another chance?
"A day Late Flightr, one delayed &amp; one Cancelled Flightled flight, I'm at a gate with no seat assign. Lots of standby ppl also waiting."
flight to PHL from FLL Cancelled Flighted 2/21 no flight available until 2/24 done with SW. They are a pain to deal with
@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
Yes I am. 2495/1170. RNO departure at 1229 on 2/25 w/connection at DFW to LGA. I can do the 1120am to LAX and then to JFK
@USAirways 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people exec bene's not honored
3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to #CommunicationFail
I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
Any plans to implement a call-back system on your reFlight Booking Problems line? Been on hold for over an hour now...
its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
"@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!"
"yes, We have de baggage claim, I'm so sad for the baggage and how They treat Us 😞 please we need That baggage"
- blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
"but don't you worry... took good care of me... Your loss, their gain."
you guys are gay
Why let someone from black Twitter in their multimedia department?
why 730 and not 645 as scheduled?
Can't DM you because you don't follow me.
"Got rebooked on AA.  One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled?"
hv wounded vet stuck in Chi. He's traveling to NY 4 healing. Need fly ny Late Flightst AM by 9 2 catch intl flt. Help!
@USAirways got rebooked. Sent to A9. Wrong gate! Traveled back to B13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated
"already spoke to that line, unwilling to help - really poor support #hitawall"
"just give up.  Your service is terrible.  If I wasn't forced to use United on certain routes, I never would."
"You rerouted my bf's flight and he's diabetic with little insulin; even though we tried to change it, the agent wouldn't do it"
I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won't pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad
"Thanks! Bleh, disconnected! Let's try this again!!"
#flight #Cancelled Flightled...tried to get refund but on hold. Can I get it after my flight would have departed?
ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
"I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers...."
it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
:/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe.
typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight...
@USAirways 2day: no coffee &amp; 1 working toilet.  Then I read domestic airlines whining re: foreign competition.  Coincidence?  No  #openskies
"1491 DEN -&gt; DFW. We don't want to be ticketed on a new flight, just refunded for our Cancelled Flighted flight."
"don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable."
"Miami-PhL flight Cancelled Flightled just as I got to the gate. No one from AA around, no one on the phone. Awful awful awful."
"submitted a case to AA customer relations two weeks ago, no word ever since! whats the point of even having CR?"
what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
@USAirways really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday.
@USAirways bumping people off a flight ten minutes before takeoff because the flight is overbooked #fail
Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
"and have empty ""help"" desks"
Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
"appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue"
ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@USAirways there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!!
darn! I bought it on the wrong device! No way to switch I'm sure?
 Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on
too long for 140 characters
after all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business
the app doesn't allow Canadian address. I used the mobile Canadian site and it will not let you select a passenger.
it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.
thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
" - the passenger in 7D, Flt 338 that assaulted me shouldn't have flown. I trust he's banned. Crew filed report to @FAANews"
@USAirways according to @wtop DCA seems to be recovering nicely from yesterday's snow so why are you Cancelled Flightling flights out there?
my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
"@USAirways keeps dropping my call and won't even let me stay on hold because they are ""too busy"" #idontwanttocallback"
@USAirways  is there anyone answering phones today??? Listening to same damn messages for 1:10 minutes
"@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said “It is now.” But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?"
"@USAirways Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem http://t.co/Uld0hWFkfo"
You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
"@USAirways guys I need help my reservations, tried calling and I'm told to call Late Flightr. Please help me here."
finally made it to chicago - 13 hours Late Flight.  Did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. Never again. Good bye.
@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
@USAirways ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight!
there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay
I'm curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate
"My flight 1108 was Cancelled Flightled. I need to be rebooked, and I can't do it online and they aren't answering calls. Help!"
4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.
"nope. Called, lost the seating preference I paid for, and here I still sit. We'll see what happens w/ my flight Late Flightr."
@USAirways it takes a month?
@USAirways outbound flight: 2 hour delay b/c air traffic &amp; 2 gate changes dividend miles member gets no email or text updates
arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt.
"can't DM, you're not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats."
why was flight 4199 out of Boston tmrw @ 1230 Cancelled Flightled?
can't DM you without you following me...
I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it's changed to refreshments. Where's my refund?
"I need to go to YYZ tmr morning 8am. I switched to United already, but my bag is still off in AA la-la land."
"if you can get us on a flight to Vieques all will be good. Right now, not looking promising."
"Howdy, having trouble getting rebooked after flight Cancelled Flightled. Can't get thru via phone and Web erroring out. Can you help?"
My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
"flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac ""waiting for papers""... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !"
they tried to have us towed. Do you think I'll be flying out of your terminal again? Risk of $75 fine from corrupt police official
@USAirways Now the next plane had a broken seat!  My row!  Another hour delay!  #mad
I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats...
@USAirways you reminded me today why I fly @SouthwestAir
I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
Lost my wallet on flight 1007 yesterday from Houston to Bogota. Filled out your online form. No response yet.
DFW GATE 16 to BMI agent seriously is beyond incompetent.  Never flying AA again if can be avoided #fail #pathetic
" I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was."
@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways any direct number to dividend miles account info? Every Time I try them I get actually hung up on
"why did I not receive drink coupons with 65,000 points? But all my friends did?"
@USAirways  will be stuck in PHX overnight.  Service is getting worse.  Flying southwest from now on.
I DMed you my AA &amp; phone #s &amp; you can't have someone call me? What was the point of your response? You didn't resolve anything!
"@USAirways me too. In the future, have a better harsh weather preparedness plan. So much of your staff called out that everything snowballed"
how often are airplane seats/tray tables cleaned and sanitized? rather have air purifier and clean seats than #wifi 😷😱
@USAirways plz plz plz hold 4438 to EYW. The 810 PHL &gt;CLT is sooo Late Flight. Gonna miss the connection for @jabevan221 's 40th #GTH239

this is the biggest joke of #customerservice I've ever seen from a  ✈️ brand http://t.co/XHSUUpHeZe
how's my refund coming along??
"I use to #LUV swa but after an hour and counting on hold, for a flight they Cancelled Flighted on me? #noluv"
@USAirways no wonder you are the lowest rated airline in america. #shameful #USAirways
I will but right now I'm to angry
"3 hrs searching for flts, find 1 on site &amp; can't book the $ offered bc 1 seg isn't really available. #lies #falseadvertising"

delete your account @JetBlue
It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
I called reservation at 1 am and I'm still waiting for someone to call me back
no gate agent after 30 minutes to let us off the plane???? WTW / grounds crew is here / hope you're ready to cover my delay
@USAirways no word on delay reasons @LGB but Twitter is aflame with flight tracking computer crash. Rumors. True or Not?
Whoa! No tag and you still saw my tweet. Flight 105 JFK to Chicago. Trying to get home to see my little brother wrestle!
you Cancelled Flightled my flight tomorrow (without telling me) and I want to rebook-please help me book a new flight! What # can I call?
so the last seg of my flight from Denver (DEN) to hayden/steamboat (HDN) for 8am got Cancelled Flightled and I need help finding my luggage
not yet! Supposed to get it early evening tonight. Don't want to have to go to the store and buy new necessities.
i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
3 + hrs w/out bags being returned to us after flight 2464 Cancelled Flightled. Maybe put a couple people on it?
Thanks.    This one was delayed an hour and a half prior to scheduled departure.
@USAirways Feeling helpless at Tanpa airport. How can I talk to someone. Flight delayed 4 times. Need help. Missed connections will be prob
I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3
- why does my TSA-pre work with every airline BUT you? I pay good money for that. Spent 30 mins on phone to fix to zero success.
can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
 Sent a couple messages to the email you provided but to no avail. Will try again next year. Cheers.
Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
@USAirways I had a rep 10 min in who said she couldn't help so transferred me to dividend miles customer service
"can you follow me? Flight Cancelled Flightled, can't rebook online, been on hold for 2 hours.  Would love to DM flight info. Thank you."
today take flight to san francisco. .. refuse to let us board with baby early... time we board wont let us take baby carryon bag
has become like every other airline #crooked I can't believe they are taking over $500 #shouldwearmasks #shocked
"@USAirways husband tried to use dividends &amp; companion fair for emergency, transferred &amp; put on hold for over two hours gave up #disappointed"
How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
"its been five days, I'm just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don't want to have to take this higher up."
@USAirways F623 DEN:PHX impressive lack of concern by 1hr+ Late Flight flight attndt wrecking havoc on customer travel #smugsmirk #norush
@USAirways 59 minutes now. Nice customer service you got going on.
question - was given food vouchers but can't use on plane..how   come
"According to TV passenger interviews, the landing was far from ""uneventful"" with heavy (panic) breaking to"
LITERALLY just told me they'd rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to Dr. appointment. WOW
I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
where do we start? I've already wasted 1.5 hrs of phone wait time already :-(
yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am.
Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
"I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz."
I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don't have that ID- you should find it
united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
"I always brag about ur service, but very disappointed today. Apparently I'll be sleeping on floor of Dallas airport tonight 👎"
yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
@USAirways- can you tell me what the policy is for preboarding with small children? Is that still a thing?
I wish I would've known so I could've slept 2 hours more and let my friend know not to wait for me after she lands...
I am going to stop flying with you.  Delays everytime.  This time due to paperwork?
"In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
Did you discontinue nonstop service from SJC to BOS? Can't find 471 or 472 anywhere
"week is going to make up for anything, or put me at ease.  You should be asking me how you can fix things, how to..."
we've been on hold for hours.
@USAirways Look at that. The flight I have been trying to book for 3 days is gone. I guess someone got through. Thanks! Keep up the #Failing
You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
ask @j_beatz247 but I teach marketing at a university and will gladly consult on customer service and how NOT to treat passengers.
you're customer service is terrible. #NeverAgain #flywhonotblue
ya but u weren't sitting on the plane.
will you please tell me if I'll make my flight out of here tomorrow 8am? I've been tryin for 3 days now to leave
"there's a lot of talks and no doing.
just learning about your famous apology in social media marketing. Is Twitter an asset for Jet Blue now? @PhD_Mama_
why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination?
"@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me."
waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. That's the last flight out tonight. HELP http://t.co/hBsJ2sF17h
20 minutes on hold waiting is ridiculous......
@USAirways My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times...
@USAirways your service sucks.
I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off &amp; left http://t.co/IpaamZT7Z2
"@USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE."
"@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH"
agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
any ways to get through the 50 minute wait to book a flight?
"coming up on 10 hrs and all at the gate, not leaving and without my baggage. SWA you are my nightmare!"
@USAirways still can't get a real person on the phone to book a flight. Ready to just go with #jetblue since they care. #usairwayssucks
crashed trying to check in.
@USAirways how do I get thru on hold 3 hours 5 minutes . Is this normal ? My call is lost
@staralliance Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail
@USAirways 4 hours . How do I change my flight that was Cancelled Flightled ?
"If it was simply a minor mechanical, why would they say that?"
still waiting
had to rebook through Atlanta &amp; now drive to #Nashville. Had to pay ridiculous price difference. Bad weather good for business
I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I'd like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.
also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
@USAirways can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please.
...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me.
"here's part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn't print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass"
#CustomerService #fail long time flyer switching airlines #frustrated
@USAirways I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend
Fuck you.
"I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
@USAirways 25 mins after the scheduled departure and still sitting in terminal. Communication would be lovely... http://t.co/pkAxUNYfn2
"@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice"
yea but I was hoping to avoid the ticket difference amount as a birthday courtesy? #flysouthwest #lovesouthwest #mybday
never flying with you guys ever again. The customer service is piss poor at best.
@USAirways Wishing we had our luggage. 2 days now. Had to pay our way from St Thomas to San Juan. Spent extra $$$ because of this mess up.
@USAirways can someone please tell me who I have to talk to #getittogether #findurgrip
@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
I wait 2+ hrs for CS to call me back re why  flt is cxld/protection &amp; they hang up the minute I answer on 1st ring?
 I have no interesting flying with you after this. I will Cancelled Flight my next four flights I planned.#neverflyvirginforbusiness
Somehow between DFW and MIA I got bumped from 12B all the way to 41G on 2312? What's up with that?
"@SouthwestAir, a complete horror show. Flights bumped three times today, before noon, not how to run an airline. #cantblametheweather."

@USAirways @jtrexsocial exactly! How? I've been disconnected 3 times!!!!
I'm in line at the airport right now. Will you cover hotel fair or am I to sleep in the airport?

I've used you guys for 10 years but after this experience I will NEVER EVER use you again.
@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
“Inconvenient” is such a convenient word.
Yes. I figured an hour was a long enough time to hold before giving up. Can somebody call me?
I am trying to change a ticket for travel on Monday that cannot be changed online. Anyway faster than waiting on hold? #anhour
we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids

If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.

 Looks like a broken link for your assets https://t.co/OArDjjGrrD
So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
. does that mean you don't have a policy for destroyed luggage?
@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
"if you are going to be inconsistent enforcing your rules, I'd prefer you not randomly take it out on freq flyers that obey"
@USAirways not happy!! Trying to get home on Cancelled Flighted flight&amp; been on hold for 2 hours. Help!! This is just crazy...
is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
@USAirways 2 hours and counting waiting to get into a gate in Philadelphia. Just icing on the cake for a miserable flight experience

#last #flight #ever on #AA. You botched this weather delay to the point of absurdity. I'd pay more to fly @Delta

"Clients got ZERO, in 32 years career never thought this was possible.2 suitcases worth thousands of $$ in Italian clothing robbed."
We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad.
@USAirways delays to the max
"been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said ""we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch""!"
"@USAirways new slogan should be ""if you don't want to arrive on time, pick us"""
@USAirways another bad experience today.  Frozen pipes on 597.  Missing connection.
Hello United. You should take care of your call center in Mexico City Office. Terrible attitude from the lady who was helping me.

thanks ^mr i got rebooked already but I lost my first class seat. Such is life.
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!
the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
"was earlier, for reFlight Booking Problems flight I'm on now. Didn't get a screencap, just said ""unspecified error"" and to call SWA"

it's ok...I forgive you guys.
"last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal."

A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
@USAirways would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I'm staring at empty overhead room.
their flights into Buffalo as well -- You were the only flight Cancelled Flightled!!!
flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded
@usairways hi. You lost my father's wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me.
was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
"@USAirways Cancelled Flightled flight this AM. There was avail flight to PHL today u said was sold out. I had to buy 2nd ticket, u need to refund me."
a school trip of 38 including myself had to sleep over in the airport and are all on different standby flights.This is not good
flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500
".Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?"
"Nice try I heard your crew whisper ""she's still at the hotel, she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow"""
@USAirways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn't even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed
@USAirways What a great way to kick someone when they are down. Cancelled Flight a noon flight and rebook me on one two hours south from here tomorrow
"no, you should do something about everything happened yesterday..."
no seat assignment 5 mins before a flight...line 20 people deep. Guess I'm sitting with the baggage? @MarinaDomine
Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
"45min wait to get de-iced in Tulsa.Not good service.Looks like everyone will miss connections, not due to weather. Fight is on"
it's ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago
@UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
@USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $.
@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
"Lots of upset people, freezing terminal, and no gate agent. Kept us waiting on plane beyond allowable time length."
"but really, can you DM me on here to verify if you've booked a hotel for our extra night here? Kinda unsettling to get a call"
almost an hour on hold for swa is inexcusable #hiremorepeople
I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger
"@AmericanAir...still waiting for a call back....attempt #9 and hour #13...can't put a hold on an online tix, we are within seven day window."
you have let me down. Seriously. #unhappycustomer
Mold on my flight?!? US3825 #filthyplane #hopeidonotgetsick http://t.co/zIK2UoXGnW
make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful
I'm getting calls from 1-800-433-7300 but the calls seem to drop instantly. Is there any alternate avenue for resched. support?
you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
Delayed more and more these days. MCO &gt; IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K
"Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter."
@USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem
is the worst
@USAirways I was supposed to get from fresno to pittsburgh by 10pm.  Instead I'm now not getting in until 4pm... tomorrow
"so I'm penalized for packing lightly, having 1 bag and paying extra for a seat?"
"@USAirways that's understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate"
@USAirways thanks for a subpar travel experience and it's not even over yet #stepitup
I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
we've been on the runway for over an hour. Now the water pressure is low and taxiing back for maintenance. #1572
"appreciate the response but already spoke to a MCO and their response was ""There is nothing we can do"" idk if that's what you mean"
"no they offered the flight (4/19), I paid, then they changed it.This is the 2nd  time you have done this to me. ruins cruise plans"
most disgusting chicken entree I've ever seen.  Your standards have seriously nosedived. #NewAmerican http://t.co/56eSsfOOwt
@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!
anything serious I should worry about?
"I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited"
@USAirways I'm logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it
"instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays."
"@USAirways Well, that's a problem considering I need to book a flight tonight for this weekend... is there anything you can do?"
"It's not ideal, but it's okay. Better Late Flight than never! :)"
75 minutes and still waiting for skis to be unloaded. You should be ashamed. It's 1:30 in the morning.
now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs
lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
"@USAirways - what a disaster! Flight 3739, missed passenger count by 5 since it was done manually!!  Really???"
Received email w/reso's to my email that isn't associated to SWA account I own with CC info for my sister. #FRAUD please DM me
poor performance all around! Paid for Express checkin weeks ago and can't even leverage it #bullshit
@USAirways thank you so much for asking us to pay $700 to switch to a different flight so I could spend more time with my dying nephew.
@USAirways checked into my flight yesterday and have been bumped to a Tuesday flight! Unacceptable and no agents to speak to!
@USAirways - have dinner reservations in a few minutes -- and I've been trying to get through to you since BREAKFAST. #onholdwith
"VERY frustrated. Saw seats avail. online for pref alt. flight, unable to book online, lost those seats during &gt;2 hr phone hold"
should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
I really hope it departs. They said is because the catering service wasnt available but we can see it next to plane doing nthin
I was told by customer service that only customer relations can extend the expiration date of my unused travel funds.
"if my flight gets Cancelled Flightled i should be able to reschedule to any date i want, not the next day or 2 days after"
@USAirways contd.. They put her on 7 pm flite tonite. I think she's on now. Worst customer service ever! U need to fix it.
I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn't there be some sort of compensation?
@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
cut it. Put me on a flt tomorrow.
First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate
I unfortunately didn't get her name :( she was not nice!
@USAirways  worst customer service ever how can you let people be assaulted on your flights and do nothing about it
"can't book a flight because of outdated, forced opt-in ""Verified by Visa"" nonsense. Help a girl out? I just want to get to @sxsw"
Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
"Yes, I filed a report in Atlanta. My bags are in Charlotte, NC. 24 hours Late Flightr and still can't find my luggage ... @USAirways"
Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
ok we got as far as Atlantic City due to JFK being closed. Can you get us to HPN or LGA?? Please?
got it wish they would communicate more w us
"yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing."
Still waiting news about my bags 48hrs already happened and this company don't give to the passengers any certain information
boarded plane only to be told to get off as it wasn't our plane. Now an hour delay. 😭😭
False - agent let us do an extra leg room upgrade for $ but not upgrade to mint. Poor business practices. #badcustomerservice
"@TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went."
"On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this."
@USAirways why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways
"Cancelled Flightled my flight, didn't notify me, and I can only rebook by phone, but can't get through to an agent. Epic. Fail."
I think I get a faster response on Twitter than I do when I call...what's up with that?
can you not get the first flight of the day off the ground on time?   #1531.  Let's go.......
we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
@jetblue Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail
I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight.
"@USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!"
"Yes, talked to them. FLL says is at central. Central says is at FLL and here we go again. I'm betting this will go 6 mths"
25 min hold has now progressed to over an hour...919-675-0985
"“@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT” A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one."
"I waited on hold for two hours, only to have my call. Really unreliable."
"""Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."""
wow. Flight crew shows up :15 mins before the flight. No catering for AA3390. Nice. Why to treat your customers.
They told us 10 minutes almost 40 minutes ago.
@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
"thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service 👎"
will continue to be my airline of choice. -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
@USAirways terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing.
"what the...? I go into the ""all airlines lounge"" w/ my Star Alliance Club Card in BCN only to be told Star Alliance isn't accepted"
#3252 Manchester-BWI being delayed for one idiot who isn't on the plane?! We've waited 2 hours for our window and may miss it
"delayed because of salt on the floor from previous passengers? The 180 of just just want to fly, don't care about our shoes. Ua649"
@USAirways I did they are busy
"you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume, however, you never make acpt"
Can you add my KTN to an existing reservation? It's not letting me add it online....
"pity that a machine replied, or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine."
this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
"not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent."
@USAirways with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off
"3586 from IAD to BUF.  Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus.  #lowstandards http://t.co/m67WnBglXQ"
so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.
@hoagy10 how about you stop cutting and pasting apologies and get some additional phone reps to do their jobs
6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
I paid for inflight wifi only for it not to work. Download speed was 0.21mbps &amp; I ended up watching the free TV instead.
"is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat"
No no no bad airline bad! *bops you with newspaper* “@JetBlue: @maatkare67 We hope you're still our bae! @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid”
@USAirways what's going on with your website &amp; mobile app??? Help!!!
I've been calling you for 3 straight days and no one picks up. Sure there are storms but there are also #customers Holler!
was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
Having some trouble checking in. Can you please add me so I can DM you
@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
I receive bad customer service and ended up spending several hundred dollars to accommodate my family during each cxl flight
50 minute wait...still at the gate with a broken jetway. Might miss connection
what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
I love your flights! But theres always some delay unfortunately
is so sloooooow today
service staff to is less than friendly!
"how did my prime, ticketed seat get switched on AA 343?! Not sure what's going on here..."
"@USAirways flt 419. 2+ hrs Late Flight, baggage + 1 more hr. Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside &amp; out. #NotHappy"
pretty bad at #DFW no updates two flights behind doors open breeze no America airlines workers http://t.co/6MBK79mdnW
 treats service members like crap never flying again with them #UnitedAirlines  @CNN
you wanna help out? How about you reimburse the money you cause my band to lose.
the whole plane is the same. How old is this plane?  The seats leather is coming apart ay the seams.
"actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase"
"at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
" Just trying to book tickets to NYC and facing super fun broken styling. Don't worry, I'll keep trying :)"
computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
"@USAirways how about an update? 2hrs delayed, this obviously isnt up 2 date, havent boarded http://t.co/L7lWjaZiOA"
"LGA already by the time we pulled from the flight. QQBMUG. feel free to look up how many flights we've been ""reticketed"" on."
@USAirways needs to hire more people http://t.co/3LPVFhKy2F
@jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking
@USAirways where's our luggage? Been waiting more than an hour! Flight 2118.
"lipstick on a pig still a pig. Ur new baggage claim @ SJU is a disaster. No chairs, 20 mins+ wait for baggage. #fail"
App still saying I can't DM you...
Of course. That was the start of my trip 3 wks. ago. Its gone further downhill on my return.
"she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke"
that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
TY Can you confirm or deny if AA953 left JFK? I want to figure out if more delays are in store. Internet giving different info.
the pilot just stated that after 22 years of flying he has never experienced anything like this. #gettingoffplane
"submitted a case to AA customer relations two weeks ago, no word ever since! whats the point of even having CR?"
@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
if it I have not rebooked didn't get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled
@USAirways Changing my flights with no explanations and still don't have a confirmation. So disappointed in the service
Just saying the truth. You don't even an email! #2015
@USAirways #flight4592 LET US OFF THIS PLANE!!!  please go to a gate.  This is absurd.
@USAirways flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alternate? Thank you.
"my sinuses had to contend with two painful landings rather than one, and we missed a preregistration window. Beyond frustrated"
Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days

@USAirways no one at #clt knows about runway issues..my inbound flight was only one delayed..connection left without me..now I'm stuck!
@USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
"@USAirways Every time I try, the line is disconnected b/c the system says you have too many calls. Glad your screw up matters so much to you"
A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
"why would I want to when the last time I did, you screwed me out of my early boarding that I PAID FOR."
hope your flyers get a credit of some sort for all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations #shittydeal #notimpressed
@USAirways ...was Cancelled Flightled and now I need to locate my baggage
@USAirways I am appalled. My departure with you was all messed up and now on return i am supposed to fly alone with two very sick kids
Why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new MileagePlus Premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet
"I didn't say anything about patience, I said this is probably the last time I fly Southwest. I suggest others do the same."
after several miss communications I was able to get to ORD but I am not home yet and not sure I will get there due to her error
Been a member since 2007. Looking to travel next week 2/24-2/27. Couldn't book right away due to all the snow; I'm in BOS.
@usairways I've called for 3 days and can't get thru. is there some secret method i can use that doesn't result in you hanging up on me?
ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
@USAirways You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again...
flight Cancelled Flightled and was trying to reschedule but 800 number just says to call back
"And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, ""not with my hands!"" #badservice"
quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
@Rizzilient I booked tickets using miles and need to change the dates.  Have been trying to get to an advantage rep 4 two days
@USAirways likelihood of PHL to BDL actually leaving tonight? 2 hour delay so far!
"@usairways Is your reservation phone number working? Called 10x in the last 3 days, and haven’t gotten through."
@USAirways Just Cancelled Flight every flight I have why don't you.
im tryin to book a flight but cant get ahold of anyone!
@USAirways can you please have your employee that has been called 5 times by the flight crew finish maintenance on US 734 so we can depart!
very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight.
"Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can't be done online?"
@USAirways No kidding. Oy.
@USAirways Get new planes then. Got on this plane at 7:50 its 10:20 now and still on tarmac. How ru going to compensate me for this?

@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
I need to know what to do? My flight has been Cancelled Flightled and I can't speak to anyone. Help!
"@USAirways delayed 2.5 hours @longbeachairport trying to get to @PHXSkyHarbor; give us an update, please???"
too long to wait for bags when they could have been on the next flight out. The party of 4 could have waited in Albany
@USAirways 2 hours on hold. Still no answer. Horrible.
you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
I'm try to upgrade my seats to first class but the wait time on the phone is 40 minutes... can you help?
. sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
"love how ""friendly"" your staff is when asking for updates on delayed flights causing missed connections. #horribleattitudes"
so why is every single flight out of @PortColumbusCMH Cancelled Flightled for only your airline?
@USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks
"you call this customer service?? Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr, lost bag, and you give me a $100. voucher???"
@USAirways transferred 4x pleeeeeeeease help!
"have you considered adding the ""we'll call you back when we have someone free"" feature to your support line?"
@wamo66 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta.
If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
"@USAirways I was told a ""return call"" by a human"

so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
@USAirways I can't believe that you would refer me to a number no one seems to be getting through. Really? I need help ASAP!
"also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example."
- 800 is not int'l friendly
@USAirways your phone system is not working at all I have been bumped again so now I am at 3 times I need to get out of mco
"boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much"
we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
@USAirways you guys have to be the worst. We are flying into Philadelphia and have only two jetways available for an on time plane.#pisspoor

"@USAirways @PHLAirport Cancelled Flighted flight due to weather no problem, but wait for luggage for 4 hours?? IT MUST BE DELIVERED!!"
I can't work with them if the call gets cut off while I'm still holding..... Is DFW looking any better tomorrow?
@USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time!

"I was flying today to MTY Mex at 9:30am but still appear Cancelled Flight, Where can i talk for another flight?"
A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient

@USAirways not impressed with your customer service. everyone has been unhelpful and incredibly rude.
@USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible.
"@SouthwestAir: #VIPLiveintheVieyard - first time we tried to redeem pts for *anything*, it really did not go well. #disappointed"

"“@AmericanAir: @RussellsWriting Russ, please contact Reservations at 800-433-7300 for reFlight Booking Problems options.” Good luck with that!"
.@C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I've been trying since last night to get through.
A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?
can anyone assure me that the aircraft coming to Denver had left it's previous destination? Flight 3618
"UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
why does it feel like I'm being nickeled and dime to enjoy a flight with AA? I purchased a tkt but have to pay extra for a seat
Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
I can't do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can't do that time!
I had 2 fight 2 get a credit for the value of my bag but I got it. #skytrax #jetblue #corpgreed #nevertakeno http://t.co/6MBVJFlpBM
call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer
everything OK? This is my 3rd call for the day and this time I've been on hold for 1.5 hrs. I'll hang up and try again.
this is not a fair set up. I payed for a full seat. I should get access to a full seat. http://t.co/SbA0ARicyq
"AH - did DM, no reply. On hold now over 2hrs. Just spent over $1k to get a United flight tmrw to get home. #lame"
@USAirways now the 3rd issue with the plane is a fuel leak. They will let us know soon what they decide. #getmeoffthisplane #ineedabeer
so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
@USAirways nothing like back to back delayed flights let hope this one isn't 12 hours like the last time.
"@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice"
@USAirways very embarrassing.
@USAirways actually it landed in BWI 30 minutes ago. She is stranded but I have friends to help. You FAILED big time on this one.
aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won't be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?
- Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
@USAirways a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all.
"@jetblue as courtesy to Mosaic members or anyone, a request for water should be attended promptly. Daniel in flight 1557, should know better"

"@USAirways AND my rebooked flt isn't until Monday??  AND I don't get a voucher for a hotel?!  Never again, US airways."

@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly
@USAirways What is going on with flight 1826 from PHL to PHX? 10 mins to estimated departure nobody has board and no update.
What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.
"I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best"
...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...
@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
"So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail"
@USAirways looks like you lost another customer  when you stranded @41CGQueen at CLT she vows never to fly with you again #smoothtransition

YOU SUCK!
now it's delayed until 3:55. Getting yelled at by attendants not to bother them. Getting worse
@USAirways The phone line disconnects. How can I be in the queue to be answered when the phone line simply disconnects when I call?
where is the great customer service I have come to know/expect; you LUV dropped by EB check in and no help in sight!
@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
#UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.

@USAirways Flight SF to NYC only made it to Philly. Ur customer service is telling me no refund for the last leg? #offensive
DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
"no no no, YOU DM me, I pay you money and you want to me to reach out to you for help? How about the other way around"

"really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"

@USAirways was rebooked but sucked big time. Crappy layover. Customer service very sub-par.

Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt!

"That's a complete cop out! U ask what the issues are, then do nothing about it. How are we supposed to sort the situation now?"
I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
What are we going to do about the nightmare you guys out me through yesterday? Zero response from the tweet you last sent me.
"@USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain"
submitted customer care form Jan 7th. Still no response. A little longer then 7 - 10 business days
why can't you help me after you made mistake and dropped my early bird check in on your end?  Where is the LUV?
Seriously? FOUR DELAYS? Only takes 42 minutes to get to Vegas from @flyLAXairport &amp; I have a connecting flight. #ridiculous
we want room and food allowances. Agents are refusing to give us vouchers to use at rooms we book ourselves.

"@USAirways that link is broken. But if it's the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information."
@USAirways really? No meal vouchers for a 7 hour flight delay out of Virgin Islands...
Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one plane😡
@dfwairport listening to all the flights taking off over my house and kicking myself for Flight Booking Problems an AM flight tomorrow. Iceday?
@USAirways. On phone hold for 30+ mins trying to speak to an agent. Can't change reservation online. Sigh. #badcustomerexperience

"@USAirways figure it out, have had 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in the past week. Now coming home 2 hour delay, and cart that pulls plane just broke"
@USAirways please respond to me. I've been on hold on the reservations line for an hour and 45 minutes. I would really appreciate it.
they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
@USAirways bad weather shouldn't mean bad service
thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
"@USAirways this has been my WORST flying experience with you guys, you need to do better"

"@USAirways very disappointed I wasn't ""allowed"" to change seats after checking in early online for a flight tomorrow morning."

"the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher"
@usairways @usair   idiots took our plane &amp; gave it to someone else. Fudgers!!!! Flight 799 from Philly to Orlando
"understood. Just frustrating, you buy early bird check on the day they go on sale at 6:30am and get mid 'b'. Feel ripped off."
@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
"I believe it's Irina. On the flip-side, super disappointed that EatUp Cafe isn't available on this BOS --&gt; SFO flight today."
I responded. Your info different than your customer service line
lost bag on flight to Vegas. Now to El Paso. Going to Dallas love. Gate attendant said see if can coordinate to get it to Love
I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
"Are there any travel advisories for Toronto, ON today? I can't access anything regarding international travel on your website--"
Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
"@united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt"
ahhhh your silence is golden now.  This tops it all.  Anyone get fired?
still no response from AA. great job guys!
"It seems odd to be sitting on a plane that gets further delayed and you find out by txt, not the 6 emp working on the aircraft"
@USAirways over an hour is unacceptable wait time. thanks for nothing.  Be sure never to fly you again

"your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest."
I have filed multiple complaints. I prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp.
Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!
I spent over an hour of my morning on hold w/ your customer support. I want my confirmed flight to be taken care of
@USAirways baggage drop at phl b/c is incredibly backed up... unacceptable service

Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up!
I want you to pay for my parking fee at Orlando airport because your app told me my moms flight landed at 9:19 and it lied
But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous.
"I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right?"
"not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated."
"Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it's totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it's Cancelled Flightled, again."
@USAirways 2.5 hours Late Flightr and the flight has been Cancelled Flightled. You gotta work on your internal communication skills.
why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes?
how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it
No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
@USAirways it's be nice to take a flight and have some level of consistency / service from the flight attendants. Quality control???

@USAirways how hard is it to unload bags in order of arrival? 45 mins and counting for flight 699
Not really. I have a flight to catch at 1 pm in Vegas. I'm praying I don't miss the flight!
"Yes, but I like need my luggage before tomorrow morning"

"Flt Cancelled Flighted, rescheduled to bad time. Tried 800# 3hrs. Website states can't do online=useless website. Help?"
the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
"can lie to you about where your lost bag is, but we are suppose to trust them with our lives thousands of feet in the air..."
@USAirways on top or having to check my bag I had to wait over 30 min for my bag to come out at baggage claim. Thanks for wasting my time

"So break whatever you want, take no responsibility..Too bad for customer? #media #filmcrew @chicagotribune @WSJ #nytimes @CNN"
"@USAirways They provided no options. Since you all have a better sense of the weather, I hoped you could suggest."
@USAirways nope not yet...
understand you can only do so much but often it seems like a quick request to the desk is all it takes no questions asked.
"@USAirways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to ""go left"" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there"
Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
“@SouthwestAir: @TinaIsBack I'm so sorry for your frustration. Did you get rebooked? ^SW” I've been rebooked 4 times!! Still stuck!! #SMH
@USAirways I just think if I am staying w your airline &amp; rescheduling a flight I shouldn't absorb a fee that is the cost of 1/2 my flight
"Cancelled Flightling flights, sending out tickets, then not telling the buyer... #jetblue how is that allowed?"
I'd fly to an airline who actually gave a crap about its fliers outside of generic apologies. Jet Blue is terrible #jetblue

"cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers"
@USAirways I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
"- Hi. My flight confirmation # is fwwe7f. We are currently stuck in Norfolk, Va. Trying to get to LGA in NYC. Ant updates? Thx"
"Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed."
" a lot of ""apologies"" being thrown out to customers from what I can see.Very sad. Thanks for nothing. Worst airline ever."
OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
@USAirways #SOS WHERE IS MY BAG ?
"Yes. However, the seats they assign us that day are never together. I just want to sit with my husband! Why is that impossible?"
I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
"How is hanging up on customers because of ""high volume"" customer service? Tried to resolve via DM-still waiting.So bad. #aafail"
@usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought.
we were rebooked on the 5:05 out of MDW.  Some drink coupons could help!
offered to pay for tix at the airport BC we were never told that our reservation didn't go through. Was told I could pay $2275 pp.
at MSP w/3 employees trying to check in several hundred and the line is crazy might miss our plane be sure to thank these employees
 why are your first fares in May over three times more than other carriers when all seats are available to select???
Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
@USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense?
@USAirways after a crappy flight due to delays and rude staff members I'm happy to report after paying $25 to check my luggage it's ruined
6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
@USAirways the link doesn't work..

"leave us stranded, send baggage with important medication to different city for 4days&amp;apologise with a $50 voucher. appalling."
Late Flight again geez flt2417 #Late Flight #delays #typical
"5 hour delay = shortly?“@SouthwestAir: @brendanpshannon Brendan, we are so sorry to keep you waiting. We'll have you in the air shortly!^RS”"

"I ""heart"" Southwest but those commercials aimed to satisfy a nano-smattering of travelers to few destinations."
which one.?i have been booked on 6 different ones in the past 2 days
Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
@AmericanAir: my brother's flight into DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday. Are you flying from ONT to DFW today?
not happening.  Delta took care of us.  Peace!
.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
1/2 Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
Please stall flight 1535 out of ORD. I have to get to SNA tonight.
"I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything."
your gif game is strong.
@USAirways are the bags off Flight 1898 CLT to JFK? We landed last night just before midnight.
most horrendous service ever !! On off two planes. Been in Phil for 10 hrs. Now captain can't get flight info to print? #wtf
"@USAirways ur ""response"" was: my ""inconvenience was of no matter."" U wanted me sit for 3 xtra nights in the city w/out comp! #donotflyusair"
I have never seen such incompetency from a gate agent in years of business travel DFW B16 gate agent needs training or new job
"MY BAGS ARE. 1st woman said it would be there on the next flight... not there, so now Ive got nothing. Big wigs help me out"
okay I understand a delay one way. But both ways? C'mon #annoyed #flights

 It's fine. Already done with my purchase. But you should try it. Just go most of the way through then go back 3

"NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER. We've waited patiently, not to mention $150 and six months of marathon training, we need 2 be there tmrw."
@USAirways and I can't get through on any phones
we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail
customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
u have a lot of pissed off hungry tired people stuck at midway 4 over 2 hours after scheduled departure. This is inexcusable
why are you the ONLY airline that is not flying out of BNA today?
heyo! What is causing flight 1836 ewr to hou to be delayed?
@USAirways always fun to get screwed out of an earlier flight (that isn't full) #crummyservice #whydidntiflysouthwest #goodluckamericanair
This is how you have me feeling.... http://t.co/esUu0hiAjM

my butt hurts.
"hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai"
It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
@USAirways We've been on hold for over 7 hours after my wife's flight was Cancelled Flighted.
"It is physically impossible to make it to the airport, and our flight is scheduled to leave in less than 3 hours."
@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
lol too little too Late Flight
what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
@USAirways 1st flight with U.S. Air Plane had mechanical issues. Wait 90 minutes for help from customer service. No help from management
 I am in seat 4C and I cannot even open my laptop; and I paid extra for this seat!!
"I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks"
3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
"tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with now.
what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?
"@BDinDallas The personal touch you're known for, AA. Other cool perks: blaming understaffing on weather. And 3 hr hold times."

your maint delay left us stuck in den!! Flight 1080.  Been on plane for 7 hrs.  Stop flying broke french planes!
@USAirways that you would let us just switch to a different set of flights so we could spend time with the family after he passes away...
extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
another generic response guys? Cmon. You're terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX

bags fly free..just not to where you're going.

@USAirways the American Eagle plane you're using for CLT to RDU is disgusting! You should be ashamed! #disgusting #ew http://t.co/B4xhiRuGzV
The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
make that 7hours now
@USAirways  nvm my bad it's been an hour and a half #thanks
now when I call it's still at the warehouse and might be going out tonight
that would have been nice earlier  today. Too Late Flight now. I hope.
I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. I hope you didn't still charge me.
 we are going to the police dept due to the sexual assult that your stewardess allowed to occur and your lack of concern
@USAirways Why not have an option for a call back? I'm just sitting here burning through my minutes waiting for an error to be fixed.
it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
I flew back w other company since United didnt have an earlier flight
when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
"@USAirways stuck at the gate in Charlotte, NC waiting for ""release papers"" and a fix for a broken computer system."
"lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM"
is that the same reliable system couldn't find my info and then said it refund my credit card ?
so the one time we upgrade to first class our luggage was open and now missing valuable items that can't be replaced. #upset
you just Cancelled Flightled my flight home so you better get me a private jet or something. I need to get home now
does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
@USAirways three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!?
btr trained gate agts. Im a frequent flyer &amp; have nvr had issue w/my bag 2day I was forced 2 gate check while priority boarding
"flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night"
I've been on hold with international award reservations for almost 2 hours. 800-433-7300 keeps calling me. what is going on?
The flight is the wrong day. Confirm # USXLON. Departure on 5/21 should be 5/22 for 2 people
"Flight was Cancelled Flighted, I've been on hold for 50 minutes with no human interaction. I wanna get away."
@USAirways an award travel ticket but cannot since it is under a different last name. I simply need to change it
baggage delivery at BWI very delayed and unnecessarily chaotic. Disappointing after a long trip! From a frequent traveler
my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 &amp; I won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow 😭
so you guys lost my bag that had all my ski gear in it. I flew here from NYC to ski. Should I buy new stuff tomorrow? ...
Hands down the worst airline to travel with. Really really fucking bad.
once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something
@USAirways he is 8 months old and is suffering from a rare form of cancer. Your customer service agents had no compassion and I am disgusted
that luggage you forgot...#mia.....he just won an oscar😄💝💝💝
- we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
@USAirways What is happening? Have been sitting in Philly for hours. Pls take care of Flight 759 to Chicago. At least least us know! #soLate Flight
@USAirways your people are kind and hardworking the infrastructure you have given them is horrid #massivefail #failphone #fail
we've been at the gate a long time. We're gonna miss our connection at MDW. Ack! http://t.co/qRXvZFrD1Z
"@USAirways I'm sure the people are working very hard, but the systems should assist with IVR prompting, offering call backs, hold wait times"
20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
".all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim"
@staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out.
 once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
"@USAirways grades for this trip
@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?
due to gate agents I missed my connecting flight to Mexico City...not a happy customer AA- let's correct this
4369. about 4 flights all using same gate w/buses to the planes.  Awful boarding process. Hour and a half Late Flight
this is not a flight delay this is horrible planning on Jet Blue!!! #jetblue
"#CustomerServiceFail - - almost missed flight - long slow BWI ticket line: ""Rather make a complaint or your flight?"""
"@USAirways Thanks means a lot after I was verbally cussed out, charged extra for a bag, &amp; then told "" I don't feel like dealing with it"" 😒"
@USAirways Are you guys awake? Need help with delayed flight to get protected on Late Flightr flight from PHL.
or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
"Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine."
your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix.
@USAirways care to elaborate on why CHA to DCA is Cancelled Flightled this evening?
You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
trying to get anyone on phone. Flt Cancelled Flighted. Please get me to Denver.
No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone.
- been on hold forever. My first flight was Cancelled Flightled but my 2nd flight is still on time - HELP!
now the weight restriction? 'We'll try to get as many of you as we can on this plane'
"why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?"
This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies &amp; expressing that.
@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
"Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage."
"has Cancelled Flighted their last 3 flight into SHV tonight &amp; all flights for tomorrow, Feb. 23, out of SHV and multiple flight into SHV."
@emrey35 But it says your agents are too busy and to try back Late Flightr???
I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won't waive change fee for flights I had to Cancelled Flight due to east coast storms.
"You have very unhappy customer. After waiting 20 min on hold, rude &amp; uncaring rep has now frozen my acct. can't print bdng pass!"
Why doesn't provide a means for dialogue?  What is the fear that drives this decision?  #worstcustomerserviceever
I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
" is todays flight from Palm Springs, Ca to JFK in NY Cancelled Flightled?"
"@USAirways when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn't care less"

@USAirways not given option for new flight! Why can't we get a plane PHL-MIA? 20years as an #eventprof this is worst travel experience ever
"Friend stuck in bus on runway at PEK with two small kids no customer service, no explanation, kids crying, awful service."

i was spoken 2 like I'm an idiot and that is not OK!! I don't need to deal w/ that esp after the travel experience I've had
new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
I've witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. #rude

"doesn't want to deal with me, but the world might want to know how they are treating their customers: http://t.co/sKKewqhssG"
You already Cancelled Flightled the one b4 us to DCA
How clueless is AA. Been waiting to hear for 2.5 weeks about a refund from a Cancelled Flightled flight &amp; been on hold now for 1hr 49min
" can't check in, your site looks like this every time it loads http://t.co/kAcY2AwDbW"
"my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55."
@USAirways telling a man theres NO FLIGHTS for the next 10 hrs!!! NO standby! NOTHING! NO OPTIONS! trying to get to sick child! #FireVan!
@USAirways 4097 DCA to BNA. Just told they need to do 1.5 hrs worth of maintenance. Was supposed to leave at 8:50 am. [sigh]
how do I see your report team?
"has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones, thanks!"
@jetblue you just directed me to your mobile website. Where is the direct link? GET IT TOGETHER!
What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution
@USAirways I've tried calling 3 times the past 3 days and I keep getting told to call back. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME
no. U guys suck. I'll never fly with u again. And ur supervisors suck too.
… Been trying to book a whole new flight since 2 hours!! what is wrong with your website?
@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
@USAirways is absolute crap this week!!
thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
"flight AA1119, cx to AA157. Killing my layover, still wanting breakfast. I'm hungry! Get me to DFW!"
"@USAirways call the number listed? sure! by next Friday, I should get a real live person on the line http://t.co/8TJUuM22dD"
Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting
they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!
Flight's Cancelled Flightled. Website says to call phone number.Phone says to check online.  How am I supposed to get some help?
@USAirways Please staff your flights approproately. Our entire flight is delayed because FA isnt here. I shouldnt have left Delta...
@USAirways Thank you glad to be home. There were lots of delays with the plane and flight crew didn't show up. It was very frustrating.
"redirect my flight without telling me, service is abysmal."
why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous
@southwestair I've been on hold for 2 hours to reschedule my Cancelled Flightled flight for the morning. What gives? I need help NOW
I understand weather is not your fault but ur cs reps are atrocious. I am NOT happy nor will I EVR fly w/ u again.
@USAirways have you heard about the debacle at DCA? What is happening with our New Orleans flight? #wewanttoknow
you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
.I can't even get on the phone with your reservations team. The system automatically disconnects us.
 I called a 3-4 weeks ago about adding 3 flights from 2014 to my Elevate...they still haven't shown up...help!
"@USAirways I didn't Cancelled Flight my flight, you did. Than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags"
need2know if Ill be able to reach IND today.Rather stay in MAF that fly to DFW &amp; find out I can't travel http://t.co/gVgKHbx1RB
but they refused to unload our luggage so we're stuck in below freezing weather w/o our cold weather clothes.
"not terribly inspired to call ""customer service"" in the future now."
I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
Flight Cancelled Flighted and rebooked but agent made a mistake and booked wrong date! Been trying to get through via phone for hours!!
I need to be back home tomorrow and no one is helping me. Please help me rebook for a flight tomorrow!
@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
"@USAirways No, they won't because after 5 hours of holding I had to give up because I couldn't borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours..."
I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don't understand why there wasn't a better estimate 3 hrs ago
where is our luggage
Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
" All of group E was told there was no more room in the bins. when I got on the plane, was room for at least 4 bags in my row!"
"Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled."
now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight.
kudos to the #RSW CS crew for re-routing PAX to alleviate Over sale due to down graded EQP 800 now 500
oh look you just delayed our flight an additional half hour now arriving at 6 officially five hours after planned. 😡😡😡😡😤😤😤
Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
@USAirways churn rate increasing by the second
@jetblue is the website down? Can't print boarding pass
@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
some woman stole my seat on the plane but I was the one that had to sit elsewhere. Is that standard protocol?
what's up with the random delay on flight 1729? Any chance of it being a false alarm?
It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail
flight 1136 from Chicago to Houston over 2 hours and no pretzels or peanuts?! Seriously about passed out.
is not a company that values it's customer &amp; after reading tweets to them I'm not the only one who feels that way #lostmybusiness
I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
Hey SWAir- a very tortured boarding on flight 1971 due to one gate agent having to board assisted folks one at a time.
have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp; NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6
"@USAirways I did, but i need to get a human being. What's the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer."
disappointed with the missed connection from ROC to SLC and no reimbursement even tho friend who is a pilot said it was due to ATC
We're hoping to hear from you actually.
@USAirways is there a number to call to modify reservation.  Please help. Very frustrating with american and us air merger
why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
".(2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue."
"very frustrated with your customer service.Open seats on earlier flight, $154 to change. What a rip off!!"
32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
"@USAirways after 5 flight Cancelled Flightlations we finally get a flight, get to the gate on time &amp; you've given our seats away? Seriously??"

Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
@USAirways that is the most useless tweet I've ever seen out of you.
wasn't just a delay. Your counter wouldn't take a valid CAC card as a valid ID which is needed for a TSA precheck on pass
thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
"I would like to talk to a customer service agent about the service / non service I received on my last flight a a week or so a go

@EllaHenderson the highlight of being delayed #freeconcert

@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
"thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy"
I want the flight I have on hold. I don't want a new flight.
This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj

@USAirways I do but the real ? Is why your staff can behave offensively. Flight 699. Please look into it. Message me if you want particulars
"No, when I call AA now I can't even get on hold...can you help me?"
"why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?"

"she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled"
please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
well I'm glad I got up at 5 am so I can sit in an airport.  No place else I'd rather be (not)
at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
but seriously if my cats dead I'm going to be pissed/very thankful because it is evil and wants my soul
"frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
@USAirways but my bag is still missing

a friend is having flight Cancelled Flightlations out of LAX to CMH on Feb 23. Anyway to help her? 800 number has been no help
@USAirways you're killing me from the inside
why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
@USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here.
I just wanted Southwest to know that I don't think they're as great as I used to anymore. Nothing to look into.
what is the reason for the delay
I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.
I did... no response back
and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
"I am scheduled for the morning, 2 days after the fact, yes..not sure why my evening flight was the only one Cancelled Flightled"
"You can pass that along to my wife, daughter, daughter's friend, my elderly mother-in-law.  They spent several hours waiting."
"sitting on plane in Columbus, supposed to leave an hour ago. Now the mechanic can't find a tool to service the shock absorber."

@USAirways denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg 5163 to Phl @ 6..so I had to take delayed 3751 4 hrs Late Flightr...except u lost bag in cvg
is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
1hr 46 min. Cost of flight change $788. Was $188 2hrs ago b/f drop call. Cancelled Flighted flight. Asked 4 refund.

you have said the same thing to me over and over again but phrased differently. How about some actual help?
"@USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you ""hope"" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you."
thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ

You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.

The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
What else could possibly take the place of coffee at that hour??Hope pilot wasn't relying on aircraft for caffeine. #needcoffee
@USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them.
@USAirways is anyone working today?? Anyone want to pick up a phone?
@USAirways is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa.
It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don't I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago?
"@USAirways I'm on vacation, This is the LAST thing I want to be doing. Is anyone even answering the phone?"

how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
@USAirways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh

already spent $300 to stay at hotel last night due to you guys rescheduling my flight. Since my Cancelled Flightation I've spent almost $500

When will the flight resume? I don's see it in the open schedule. :/
@USAirways Good grief! Flight Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold since 0400.
but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle

are people in an exit row still supposed to give their verbal approvals? I was never asked on the flight I'm on...
that's bull. Once you add a fare to the cart you should be locked in. I made it all the way to PayPal.
@USAirways Please can someone contact me regarding my missing bag? It has been 3 days. Online tracking shows nothing.
"@USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?"

Contacted yesterday and was told that there's nothing they can do - they suggested I email for some compensation ??? cust service???
why would it take that long? My credit card company says the card hasn't been charged yet. Should it take 5 days for this?
yeah I'm aware of that. Hence my original msg to you.

@USAirways No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable.
I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
the flight is not going to make the connection to #MEX #AA2444
my mom tried also. That wasn't the reason they wouldn't change it. Y'all literally said that you'd rather have an empty seat.
@USAirways Need to talk to a person about my bag. Waiting on hold for two hours. Bag s!b delivered last night. Online says not found.
"wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united."
.received an error online and have been on hold for over 1.5 hours. Completely unacceptable.
"I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach"

"I tried for 5hrs to contact SW! Twitter, fb, phone, email w/ no reply. 24hrs Late Flightr u respond, what could you do at this point?"
@USAirways I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX.
they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
flight delayed 3 times today due to flight officer. 4333 from pit to ord. 5 hour delay to date. #bademployeeproblem?
@USAirways they finally answered. They were rude and didn't help me at all.
bad weather and multiple Cancelled Flighted flights has us all scared!  Noted for next time.
two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
"your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed"
"Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
Service rep didn't say I was dumb just had the tone of voice like I should have known about it.
"Great!  I'm guessing you were Late Flight to open, service is horrible, you're overcharging, and don't care that everyone is miserable."
Additional fare cost $19.. Tix change price 195 UK Pounds ($304). $19 not the issue the 195 UK Pounds IS ! #badcustomerservice
@USAirways This is dating back to Nov. I have been sent back and forth between you and @eDreams_en. It's a disgrace.
I hope your system wasn't hacked cause someone else's passport info was on my reservation &amp; I couldn't get my boarding pass
it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :)
Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
she has...she hasn't heard from anyone in over a week. a nonstop flight and her baggage was lost/stolen. customer service 👎
Flight 52 got Cancelled Flightled 6 hrs before takeoff. No Customer Service. Been on hold for 30 minutes.
@USAirways what is going on with the computers? Why is my flight grounded? Why does your airline suck so much? #UnansweredQuestions
https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
"I'm checked in, agent wouldn't tag my bags at 7am. Now I'm standing in line hell."
"thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight."
@USAirways thanks for the seat that doesn't recline. I'm shocked I'm not being asked to serve everyone drinks on the plane.  #DoBetter
sitting in Newark because flight 4179 was Cancelled Flightled for no apparent reason.  All I was told was sorry after 2.5 hrs waiting
now down to only one agent helping a stagnant line of almost 100 customers. Super.
as a customer it feels like i should stick to airlines other than jet blue. I travel for my work for past 5 years never seen $70
actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
"yep—used that twice; no case id numbers assigned; just tried it again-get screen that says, “thank you for submitting your request”"
I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
is ridiculous! UA6 delayed for 3.5 hours and counting. Should have booked with a diff airline that takes it seriously #unitedsucks
This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
"I'm counting on you, please don't let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce"
NOR @SpiritAirlines fly to Toronto?!?!? You're killing me smalls.......
@USAirways flight 849's four subsequent delays destroyed my travel plans this evening. Looking to resolve this matter.
"I understand. But it's consistent, and been consistent for years. It's known around the country."
thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
"after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!"
@USAirways @PHLAirport this is the reason I avoid @PHLAirport and @USAirways like the plague. Glad to see this merger is working well. #dumb
"@USAirways and at this point I don't need sorry, I need a revers agt to pick up the call so maybe we can make the 11:30 flight today"
but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
"no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch"
@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys…see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
JFK NYC staff is amazing. The #lax JetBlue... Sending an email with details but it was a disappointing experience @JetBlueCheeps
@USAirways what am I paying you $275 for?   Fly the damn plane!  Not one announcement from the crew.  Let me know how you wanna refund me.
"@USAirways -not just this trip, been a few. Ur saving grace is ur cheaper flights. Now willing to pay more 4 bttr service on bttr airlines."
why can't @dfwairport have the capability to spread salt on a runway?!
@USAirways now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep?
@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
I start a new job tomorrow &amp; you Cancelled Flight my flight (1629 BWI-LAX) and you really can't get me on another flight today ?!
@USAirways DeeDee and Lynn S. have been great here in PHX; Richard P. here was a jerk. Rude to us and our parents for no reason.
"line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail"
im still waiting??? No answer!!
can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
@USAirways please hogs my next flight for me! I'm waiting on a bus to get me off one plane so I can run to the other. It leaves in two min!
"@USAirways Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever."
Didn't see travel had to be compete for unused funds by expiration date hidden in the fine print. Never saw that before.
an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever
"Repeating this is policy is basically repeating ""Fuck you"" to your customers. I'll be shopping for a new airline ASAP"
"here is my case id 8473573. Requested on 2/5, now it's 2/19... 7-10 days I'll get a response, BS!"
@USAirways your customer service is atrocious.
Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I've selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade!
your website is a complete joke when using safari!
Reservation Line won't let me speak to a representative because they are too busy. They literally disconnect you. Why bother?
@USAirways Really a letter that says you will discuss serving drunks more drinks that doesn't help the current situation
it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
Did somebody say flight upgrade?
"@USAirways stuck on the ramp at DCA, US Air computer system crashed...everywhere."
"this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board"
"now because you couldn't add my ktn, which I asked for numerous times and no one answers the phone, I missed my flight!!#upset"
compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
@USAirways you're really fudgin up with all these delays 😡 #justwantmybed
"thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united"
waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
@USAirways a member of your staff at PHL just gave us excellent customer care. Shame the same couldn't be said for the past 24 hours.
I will never fly with you guys again! I am stuck in memphis another day. Called to be credit something anything
What's up with lack coffee on 7:30AM flight. Was told someone forgot to load coffee onto the plane. What????? #INeedCoffee

@USAirways I've been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really?  A global company?  Help!
“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” the service just hasn't been great.

"@USAirways where's my bag?  You called at noon promising it today, would like an update like your website promises.  I need that bag!"
 Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. We can not get any information about our flight.
absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
Reply to - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
@USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.
"I've been in line for over half hour trying to see a representative, now I might even miss the next flight too, unacceptable"
@USAirways I have been on hold for 4 hours my flight is tomorrow do you really expect me to not sleep all night to stay on hold?!?
although I'm not happy you Cancelled Flighted my flight home tomorrow (phx to atl then dca) I am happy on how easy it was to rebook
@USAirways Delays due to faulty engine light. Great work guys. Coming up on 2 hrs sitting on the plane #WorstAirlineInAmerica
it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
"@USAirways sitting for 30 minutes on the runway at dca, because your gates are full? Early landing, Late Flight flight."
"it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous."
"4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending"

how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough http://t.co/VO61LME5ja
thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can't be determined better.
I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
#worstcustservice you should have contingency plans for extra workers during bad weather. 4+ hours hold #ridiculous
not very helpful trying to get out of Nashville.Should waive change fee for 2/18.
"is the biggest joke of a company,I will never fly with them again! 3 days now waiting for my bag, they don't even know where it is!"
"coming up on 2hrs on, still haven't spoken to a rep"
Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock
"customer service was so bad updating my points, once I use my next points, I won't be flying you. Point system is almost a sham."
"Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily."
truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
@USAirways You won't give us a hotel or food. Can you at least suggestion options for making it to the metro city I have a ticket to?
".You may ""dislike delays"" but I paid you .We had an agreement that I paid you and you got me to my destination at a certain time."
So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
"booked a flight yesterday, appeared in my account + confirm email but since a few hours all disappeared and err ""no segment in this"""
every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.
"2100$ ticket,12h biz trvl,no wifi.Missed con flt,next one#24h,missed meeting,7$ food voucher,hotel chkout#12,flt#5,no wifi#hotel"
HELP! Attempting to Cancelled Flight a flight but can't get thru 800 number. Call gets dropped when saying Agent. flight is 2/24.
 why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it &amp; it's now impossible! I even called.
can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157
"where are our bags
@USAirways great job today In ruining 45 people's vacation. Thanks to your incompetent pilot and staff we have all now missed our flights
"@USAirways if my flight's been Cancelled Flightled, and I can't reach anyone over the phone or ticketing agents, safe to assume I wasn't rebooked?"
"1-the lavatory freezes, 2- problem with a nitrogen line 3-a low tire with the inflating equipment malfunctioning #AA2444 and..."
" seriously, though. will there not be direct flights from SFO-FLL in may???"
your customer service is inferior to that of a nationalized third world nation's airline. Get it together.
"@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone."
I was never able to talk so someone so had to buy another new ticket. Will be calling shortly for refund.
How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
tell your employees that!
it's not a friend it's a legally required chaperone on a school trip.
I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
"Hey you Cancelled Flightled my flight, and I can't get someone on the phone to rebook (2 hour wait minimum). Can I get some service?"
"@USAirways Now I am probably going to miss my connection in Charlotte, so I will have to drive home for the funeral."
@USAirways will you fly me to somewhere warm? I'm tired of this snow! :(
how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
"@USAirways As a member of the news media, the awful service of the last few days won't go unnoticed."
too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
luggage fees? won't b flying JB again! at least #AA gives platinum pass 2 bags! tired of overchging bg herded like cattle2slaughter
don't worry you won't steal my money again
@USAirways so far I've gotten six different answers
not to mention the fact that we paid extra just to fly jetblue thinking it was the most reliable..
I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
Cancelled Flighted my mileage plus award reservation G6455C same day. Have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation.
My luggage has still not been found. Luggage is not scanned until final destination. So no way of knowing where it is!
@USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.
"Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR
@USAirways And cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed ON TIME for 45 mins. Still didn't get half the luggage.
your baggage person told me to go through @AirCanada - they're handling my connecting flight.
Flight 69 (ha!) - one employee said they were reassigned another said they just left. I just want some warm weather!
why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
Landed at MCO before 9am and still don't have my bag. You were supposed to give it to Disney's Magical Express this AM.I am livid!
"@SouthwestAir, you're really going to let @delta and @virginamerica get the best of you? http://t.co/vUdWJm1lYB"
"@USAirways can you please DM me, my flight has been delayed going into CLT which will force me to miss my connection to LGA at 10:05pm"
thanks! I expected a wait... Just not that long. :)
@USAirways haven't eaten all day either so lemme get that CC# so I can buy a burger across from the terminal.  #DoBetter @UsAirwaysSuck
I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
do you expect to Cancelled Flight flights out of @DENAirport tomorrow morning given the storm?
 zoom in on the sauce and potatoes.  This stuff is vile.  And I mean vile. http://t.co/m2PHoavRxC
"Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting ""Webpage not available"" after submitting online form"
"@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard."
"Thanks that was done, I just don't understand why those whose bags couldn't fit aren't notified in air/at landing #technology"

My feedback and concerns via your site aren’t going to improve my poor airport experiences.
"@USAirways I already HAVE, four times"
Almost 2 hours on hold now. I just need to Cancelled Flight a flight and get a refund. Other airlines are operating!
"every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??"
guess that's what I get for bragging on you. I fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they don't have other options JS
just need to know why it wasn't done like it was promised it would yesterday
"By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
"@united: ""Left gate 5 minutes early.""

tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
speaking 2 languages paid off! as the US line left me over 70 min in hold -without an answer- the latinamerican solved in 20min
I would like a refund for this flight. They delayed the flight 5 times. I feel like you're making fun of us.
"@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again"
"that's what you have said for years, you are losing customers!!!!!!"
ruining vacations left and right. Who would have thought an airline can Cancelled Flight tickets without telling the buyer
"“@AmericanAir: @Andrew_Wasila We're sorry you were uncomfortable, Andrew. What can we do for you?” SMA"
@USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
you get a 2nd chance today as I fly to A'dam. Let's see if you can redeem yourself after that last horrendous trip to the states.
“@USAirways: @AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words.” Confirmation code?

@jetblue is giving me false hope of ever getting home
@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?
I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
@USAirways Why haven't you issued a travel advisory for Charlotte Wednesday night and Thursday? 4-6 inches of snow.
but we are on All Nippon now (booked by United to replace the one we missed).
UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
@USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!!
Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
@USAirways I did and it's been a disaster. You had me sitting on the runway only to bring the plane back to the gate smh
"@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange."
@KyleJudah new stroller. The travel credit doesn't help cover the cost of a new stroller. Your crew ruined it and therefore should
letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you.
it was but obviously it wasn't linked as there is nothing there when I tried to book with it.
@USAirways nothing important to do.  Why was I told to wait in the line?  #patiencerunningout

"said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?"
@USAirways I booked a flight yesterday but didnt receive an email confirmation and I my dividends number isn't registering. Please help.
"according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
@USAirways no more hotel voucher? Everyone had to get one but not me...what do I do? Arrived from Amsterdam #SnowStorm
"very exasperating I'm having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you're undergoing maintenance. Really, now?"
"“@AmericanAir: @Dumas2TTG Good morning, Tamara. We'll try to get you comfortably on a flight as soon as we can.”#NoXTraLegRoom #NoCoatCloset"
@USAirways 45 minute delay for take off and 30 minute wait for checked bags? Really?
"yeah that's all been done. Define ""incidentals""? How much can I spend on gear so this trip is not a waste?"
you Cancelled Flightled my flight to BNA. I have flight from BNA 2 MDW tomorrow AM. You stranded me in DEN. I've been on hold all day

Cancelled Flightled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? http://t.co/ypbkCiRBXu
"continue button generated a trip to ""plan your trip page"
customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable
"@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now"
this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it
"@SouthwestAir, been on hold for an over an hour now - when can we expect some customer service? #disappointed"
@southwestair does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights?
from a service rep but that hasn't happened yet. I'm honestly fed up and sick of this. No notice when my flight got Cancelled Flighted
@USAirways Why can't I check in online for a flight tomorrow am?
@USAirways we on on the flight from phf to clt. At the terminal but can't get off plane yet. Need to get on iah flight.
is flight 51 on 4/24/15 moved back? When I booked it said we arrive 11:31 but now it says 12:08 😢
can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
@poisonpill76 im in same boat.. 8am flight to Jacksonville... Get me out of here!!
@USAirways and when will one of these agents be available to speak?
@USAirways @PHLAirport always nice when a customer service manager threatens customers standing in his understaffed lines for the last hour
But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
did anyone come into work today? u should have all the pilots and flight attendants answer phones if no one is flying
"I'm not sure it will have ""next time""..."
as much i have paid in fees. Plus hotel and food because of your changes i could had flown with a more reliable airline #no2jetblue
they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel rooms...that is terrible..
@USAirways I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back #
your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
Flight 3336 - why do multiple tracking sites have more up to date info than SWA's app and website?
if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
Gate agent gave me wrong departure info and caused me to miss my flight and now I am on stand by! #NotHappy
@dultch97 that's horse radish 😤🐴
 hold times at call center are a bit much
Cancelled Flighting flights 45 minutes before takeoff &amp; sitting for 45 min on the runway of the rescheduled flight #badservice
has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
still no response??
any news on flight 122 pbi-boston delay? Can we wait to arrive at airport based on reported 1 and 1/2 hour delay?
no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
@USAirways great but that still does not help me..
"fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff"
too Late Flight now
This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse
"Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?"
"one of my luggage didn't made it onto my flight, hope it really gets here tomorrow, as I was told 😓😭"
it isn't good enough. You need to provide a phone number. Other partners do. Should be investigated by @IATA @TheFAAOnline
been on hold for over an hour to speak to a customer service rep. What the heck?? #Southwest #customerservice
- Thanks. Formed submitted. I'm not betting someone would be honest enough to turn it in though...
"I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper."
 when you take my money and do not provide a service makes for a profitable venture for your company. #IsItTheGaryKellyWay?
"humor aside, we've been stuck on the plane for two hours at the gate because bags can't be loaded correctly. What gives?"
a free check bag a food comp a flying credit something to help out now that I'm an additional 200 dollars in the hole
your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
"is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE"
I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
"@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that ""really there are 3 not 4 seats"""
We waited 40 min for our bags after a 45 min flight #nomorecheckedbags
the departure time keeps getting Late Flightr.  I'll be lucky if I'm home by 3am
don't you think a 4hr wait time to speak to an actual agent is ridiculous?! My flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning! #Getyourlife
"Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through @ 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch"
Trying to change a flight booked just 6 hours ago but online system is charging me $200 fee per passenger... could you please help?

 MY FLIGHT #2962 OUT OF CLL @ 0600 WON'T LET ME CHECK IN. PLEASE HELP. #IMPORTANTFLIGHT
